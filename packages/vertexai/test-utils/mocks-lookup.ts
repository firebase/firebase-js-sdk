It is based on the idea that energy, momentum, angular momentum, and other quantities are quantized, meaning they can only exist in discrete values. \\n\\n2. **Key Concepts:**\\n   - **Wave-particle Duality:** Particles such as electrons and photons can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behaviors. \\n   - **Uncertainty Principle:** Proposed by Werner Heisenberg, it states that the more precisely the position of a particle is known, the less precisely its momentum can be known, and vice versa. \\n   - **Quantum Superposition:** A quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until it is measured. \\n   - **Quantum Entanglement:** Two or more particles can become linked in such a way that the state of one affects the state of the others, regardless of the distance between them. \\n\\n3. **Implications and Applications:**\\n   - **Atomic and Molecular Structure:** Quantum mechanics explains the structure of atoms, molecules, and chemical bonds. \\n   - **Quantum Computing:** It enables the development of quantum computers that can solve certain computational problems much faster than classical computers. \\n   - **Quantum Cryptography:** Quantum principles are used to develop secure communication methods. \\n   - **Quantum Field Theory (QFT):** A relativistic theory that describes interactions between particles in quantum mechanics. It underpins the Standard Model of Physics. \\n   - **Quantum Gravity:** Attempts to reconcile quantum mechanics with general relativity to explain the behavior of matter and gravity at very small scales. \\n\\n4. **Learning Resources:**\\n   - **Books:**\\n      - \\"Quantum Mechanics for Mathematicians\\" by James Glimm and Arthur Jaffe \\n      - \\"Principles of Quantum Mechanics\\" by R.
