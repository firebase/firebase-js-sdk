 * Initializes an {@link Auth} instance with fine-grained control over

 *
 * @remarks
 *
 * This function allows more control over the {@link Auth} instance than
 * {@link getAuth}. `getAuth` uses platform-specific defaults to supply
 * the {@link Dependencies}. In general, `getAuth` is the easiest way to
 * initialize Auth and works for most use cases. Use `initializeAuth` if you
 * need control over which persistence layer is used, or to minimize bundle
 * size if you're not using either `signInWithPopup` or `signInWithRedirect`.
 *
 * For example, if your app only uses anonymous accounts and you only want
 * accounts saved for the current session, initialize `Auth` with:
 *
 * ```js
 * const auth = initializeAuth(app, {
 *   persistence: browserSessionPersistence,
 *   popupRedirectResolver: undefined,
 * });
 * ```
