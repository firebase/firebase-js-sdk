# Unreleased

- [fixed] Fixed an issue introduced in 7.7.0, when FCM switched to provide base64-encoded VAPID
  key to [PushManager](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PushManager) for push subscription. For backward compatibility, the SDK has switched back to using VAPID key in type [ArrayBuffer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer).
