# Unreleased
- [fixed] Fixed an issue where documents could be cached as deleted when
  they should not have been, leading to queries returning fewer results than
  they should (firebase/firebase-ios-sdk#1548).
- [feature] Added `firebase.firestore.FieldValue.arrayUnion()` and
  `firebase.firestore.FieldValue.arrayRemove()` to atomically add and remove
  elements from an array field in a document.
- [feature] Added `'array-contains'` query operator for use with `.where()` to
  find documents where an array field contains a specific element.

# 0.5.0
- [changed] Merged the `includeQueryMetadataChanges` and
  `includeDocumentMetadataChanges` options passed to `Query.onSnapshot()` into
  a single `includeMetadataChanges` option.
- [changed] `QuerySnapshot.docChanges()` is now a method that optionally takes
  an `includeMetadataChanges` option. By default, even when listening to a query
  with `{ includeMetadataChanges:true }`, metadata-only document changes are
  suppressed in `docChanges()`.
- [feature] Added new `{ mergeFields: (string|FieldPath)[] }` option to `set()`
  which allows merging of a reduced subset of fields.

# 0.4.1
- [fixed] Fixed a regression in Firebase JS release 4.13.0 regarding the
  loading of proto files, causing Node.JS support to break.

# 0.4.0
- [feature] Added a new `Timestamp` class to represent timestamp fields,
  currently supporting up to microsecond precision. It can be passed to API
  methods anywhere a JS Date object is currently accepted. To make
  `DocumentSnapshot`s read timestamp fields back as `Timestamp`s instead of
  Dates, you can set the newly added flag `timestampsInSnapshots` in
  `FirestoreSettings` to `true`. Note that the current behavior
  (`DocumentSnapshot`s returning JS Date objects) will be removed in a future
  release. `Timestamp` supports higher precision than JS Date.
- [feature] Added ability to control whether DocumentReference.get() and
  Query.get() should fetch from server only, (by passing { source: 'server' }),
  cache only (by passing { source: 'cache' }), or attempt server and fall back
  to the cache (which was the only option previously, and is now the default).

# 0.3.7
- [fixed] Fixed a regression in the Firebase JS release 4.11.0 that could
  cause get() requests made while offline to be delayed by up to 10
  seconds (rather than returning from cache immediately).

# 0.3.6
- [fixed] Fixed a regression in the Firebase JS release 4.11.0 that could
  cause a crash if a user signs out while the client is offline, resulting in
  an error of "Attempted to schedule multiple operations with timer id
  listen_stream_connection_backoff".

# 0.3.5
- [changed] If the SDK's attempt to connect to the Cloud Firestore backend
  neither succeeds nor fails within 10 seconds, the SDK will consider itself
  "offline", causing get() calls to resolve with cached results, rather than
  continuing to wait.
- [fixed] Fixed a potential race condition after calling `enableNetwork()` that
  could result in a "Mutation batchIDs must be acknowledged in order" assertion
  crash.

# 0.3.2
- [fixed] Fixed a regression in Firebase JS release 4.9.0 that could in certain
  cases result in an "OnlineState should not affect limbo documents." assertion
  crash when the client loses its network connection.

# 0.3.1
- [changed] Snapshot listeners (with the `includeMetadataChanges` option
  enabled) now receive an event with `snapshot.metadata.fromCache` set to
  `true` if the SDK loses its connection to the backend. A new event with
  `snapshot.metadata.fromCache` set to false will be raised once the
  connection is restored and the query is in sync with the backend again.
- [feature] Added `SnapshotOptions` API to control how DocumentSnapshots
  return unresolved server timestamps.
- [feature] Added `disableNetwork()` and `enableNetwork()` methods to
  `Firestore` class, allowing for explicit network management.
- [changed] For non-existing documents, `DocumentSnapshot.data()` now returns
  `undefined` instead of throwing an exception. A new
  `QueryDocumentSnapshot` class is introduced for Queries to reduce the number
  of undefined-checks in your code.
- [added] Added `isEqual` API to `GeoPoint`, `Blob`, `SnapshotMetadata`,
  `DocumentSnapshot`, `QuerySnapshot`, `CollectionReference`, `FieldValue`
  and `FieldPath`.
- [changed] A "Could not reach Firestore backend." message will be
  logged when the initial connection to the Firestore backend fails.
- [changed] A "Using maximum backoff delay to prevent overloading the
  backend." message will be logged when we get a resource-exhausted
  error from the backend.

# v0.2.1
- [feature] Added Node.js support for Cloud Firestore (with the exception of
  the offline persistence feature).
- [changed] Webchannel requests use $httpHeaders URL parameter rather than
  normal HTTP headers to avoid an extra CORS preflight request when initiating
  streams / RPCs.

# v0.1.4
- [changed] Network streams are automatically closed after 60 seconds of
  idleness.
- [changed] We no longer log 'RPC failed' messages for expected failures.

# v0.1.2
- [changed] We now support `FieldValue.delete()` sentinels in `set()` calls
  with `{merge:true}`.
- [fixed] Fixed validation of nested arrays to allow indirect nesting

# v0.1.1
- [fixed] Fixed an issue causing exceptions when trying to use
  `firebase.firestore.FieldPath.documentId()` in an `orderBy()` or `where()`
  clause in a query.

# v0.1.0
- Initial public release.
