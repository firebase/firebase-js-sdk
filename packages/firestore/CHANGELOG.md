* [`ba59a0f90`](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/commit/ba59a0f909a1eb59d23b887bba30b6f86d63c931) [#4233](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/pull/4233) (fixes [#4226](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/issues/4226)) - Fixes an issue in the Transaction API that caused the SDK to return invalid DocumentReferences through `DocumentSnapshot.data()` calls.

## 2.1.1

### Patch Changes

- [`44b5251d0`](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/commit/44b5251d0527d1aa768959765ff04093a04dd8ab) [#4189](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/pull/4189) (fixes [#4175](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/issues/4175)) - Fixes an issue that prevented the SDK from automatically retrieving custom User claims.

  be enabled via an additional import: 'firebase/firestore/bundle'. For CDN usage,
  it is enabled by default.

* [`1b5407372`](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/commit/1b54073726db8cefd994492d0cfba7c5f619f14b) [#4153](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/pull/4153) - A write to a document that contains FieldValue transforms is no longer split up into two separate operations. This reduces the number of writes the backend performs and allows each WriteBatch to hold 500 writes regardless of how many FieldValue transformations are attached.

### Patch Changes

* [`344bd8856`](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/commit/344bd88566e2c42fd7ee92f28bb0f784629b48ee) [#3943](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/pull/3943) - Removed depreacted `experimentalTabSynchronization` settings. To enable multi-tab sychronization, use `synchronizeTabs` instead.

- [`4b540f91d`](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/commit/4b540f91dbad217e8ec04b382b4c724308cb3df1) [#3939](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/pull/3939) - This releases removes all input validation. Please use our TypeScript types to validate API usage.

* [`ffef32e38`](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/commit/ffef32e3837d3ee1098129b237e7a6e2e738182d) [#3897](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/pull/3897) (fixes [#3879](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/issues/3879)) - Removed the `timestampsInSnapshots` option from `FirestoreSettings`. Now, Firestore always returns `Timestamp` values for all timestamp values.

### Minor Changes

- [`79b049375`](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/commit/79b04937537b90422e051086112f6b43c2880cdb) [#3909](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/pull/3909) - Add a useEmulator(host, port) method to Firestore

* [`9719635fe`](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/commit/9719635fe2ecbb5b981076ce4807d0df775b8332) [#3960](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/pull/3960) - Removed excess validation of null and NaN values in query filters. This more closely aligns the SDK with the Firestore backend, which has always accepted null and NaN for all operators, even though this isn't necessarily useful.

### Patch Changes

- [`a5768b0aa`](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/commit/a5768b0aa7d7ce732279931aa436e988c9f36487) [#3932](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/pull/3932) - Point browser field to esm build. Now you need to use default import instead of namespace import to import firebase.

  Before this change

  ```
  import * as firebase from 'firebase/app';
  ```

  After this change

  ```
  import firebase from 'firebase/app';

- [`4f997bce1`](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/commit/4f997bce102be272b76836b6bcba96ea7de857bc) [#3724](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/pull/3724) - Adds a new `experimentalAutoDetectLongPolling` to FirestoreSettings. When
  enabled, the SDK's underlying transport (WebChannel) automatically detects if
  long-polling should be used. This is very similar to
  `experimentalForceLongPolling`, but only uses long-polling if required.

### Patch Changes

- [`2bea0a367`](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/commit/2bea0a367da8de06bae29e1459b7cbe3cdfde540) [#3919](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/pull/3919) - Fixed a potential issue in our internal queue that could have allowed API calls to be executed out of order.

Neither query operator will match documents where the specified field is not present.

* [`a8ff3dbaa`](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/commit/a8ff3dbaacd06371e6652a6d639ef2d9bead612b) [#3418](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/pull/3418) - Use FirestoreError instead of Error in onSnapshot\*() error callbacks.

* [fixed] Fixed an issue that may have prevented the client from connecting
  to the backend immediately after a user signed in.

## 1.15.0

- [feature] Added an `experimentalForceOwningTab` setting that can be used to
  enable persistence in environments without LocalStorage, which allows
  persistence to be used in Web Workers (#983).
- [changed] All known failure cases for Indexed-related crashes have now been
  addressed. Instead of crashing the client, IndexedDB failures will result
  in rejected operations (e.g. rejected Writes or errored Query listeners).
  If these rejections surface in your app, you can retry these operations
  when IndexedDB access is restored.
  IndexedDB failures that occur due to background work are automatically
  retried.

  If you continue to see Indexed-related crashes, we appreciate feedback
  (https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/issues/2755).

## 1.14.6

- [fixed] Fixed an issue that could cause Firestore to temporarily go
  offline when a Window visibility event occurred.
- [feature] Added support for calling `FirebaseFiresore.settings` with
  `{ ignoreUndefinedProperties: true }`. When set, Firestore ignores
  undefined properties inside objects rather than rejecting the API call.

## 1.14.4

- [fixed] Fixed a regression introduced in v7.14.2 that incorrectly applied
  a `FieldValue.increment` in combination with `set({...}, {merge: true})`.

## 1.14.3

- [fixed] Firestore now rejects `onSnapshot()` listeners if they cannot be
  registered in IndexedDB. Previously, these errors crashed the client.

## 1.14.2

- [fixed] Firestore now rejects write operations if they cannot be persisted
  in IndexedDB. Previously, these errors crashed the client.
- [fixed] Fixed a source of IndexedDB-related crashes for tabs that receive
  multi-tab notifications while the file system is locked.

## 1.10.2

- [fixed] Temporarily reverted the use of window.crypto to generate document
  IDs to address compatibility issues with IE 11, WebWorkers, and React Native.
- [changed] Firestore now limits the number of concurrent document lookups it
  will perform when resolving inconsistencies in the local cache (#2683).
- [changed] Changed the in-memory representation of Firestore documents to
  reduce memory allocations and improve performance. Calls to
  `DocumentSnapshot.getData()` and `DocumentSnapshot.toObject()` will see
  the biggest improvement.

## 1.10.1

- [fixed] Fixed an issue where the number value `-0.0` would lose its sign when
  stored in Firestore.

## 1.10.0

- [feature] Implemented `Timestamp.valueOf()` so that `Timestamp` objects can be
  compared for relative ordering using the JavaScript arithmetic comparison
  operators (#2632).
- [fixed] Fixed an issue where auth credentials were not respected in Cordova
  environments (#2626).
- [fixed] Fixed a performance regression introduced by the addition of
  `Query.limitToLast(n: number)` in Firestore 1.7.0 (Firebase 7.3.0) (#2620).
- [fixed] Fixed an issue where `CollectionReference.add()` would reject
  custom types when using `withConverter()` (#2606).

## 1.9.3

- [fixed] Fixed an issue where auth credentials were not respected in some
  Firefox or Chrome extensions. (#1491)
- [changed] Firestore previously required that every document read in a
  transaction must also be written. This requirement has been removed, and
  you can now read a document in transaction without writing to it.

## 1.9.2

- [fixed] Fixed an issue where auth credentials were not respected in certain
  browser environments (Electron 7, IE11 in trusted zone, UWP apps). (#1491)

## 1.9.0

- [feature] Added support for storing and retrieving custom types in Firestore.
  Added support for strongly typed collections, documents, and
  queries. You can now use `withConverter()` to supply a custom data
  converter that will convert between Firestore data and your custom type.

## 1.8.0

- [changed] Improved the performance of repeatedly executed queries when
  persistence is enabled. Recently executed queries should see dramatic
  improvements. This benefit is reduced if changes accumulate while the query
  is inactive. Queries that use the `limit()` API may not always benefit,
  depending on the accumulated changes.

## 1.7.0

- [changed] The client can now recover if certain periodic IndexedDB operations
  fail.
- [feature] Added `in` and `array-contains-any` query operators for use with
  `.where()`. `in` finds documents where a specified field’s value is IN a
  specified array. `array-contains-any` finds documents where a specified field
  is an array and contains ANY element of a specified array.
- [feature] Added `Query.limitToLast(n: number)` , which returns the last
  `n` documents as the result.

## 1.6.3

- [changed] Improved iOS 13 support by eliminating an additional crash in our
  IndexedDB persistence layer.

## 1.6.2

- [changed] Fixed a crash on iOS 13 that occurred when persistence was enabled
  in a background tab (#2232).
- [fixed] Fixed an issue in the interaction with the Firestore Emulator that
  caused requests with timestamps to fail.

## 1.6.0

- [feature] Added a `Firestore.onSnapshotsInSync()` method that notifies you
  when all your snapshot listeners are in sync with each other.
- [fixed] Fixed a regression that caused queries with nested field filters to
  crash the client if the field was not present in the local copy of the
  document.

## 1.5.0

- [feature] Added a `Firestore.waitForPendingWrites()` method that
  allows users to wait until all pending writes are acknowledged by the
  Firestore backend.
- [feature] Added a `Firestore.terminate()` method which terminates
  the instance, releasing any held resources. Once it completes, you can
  optionally call `Firestore.clearPersistence()` to wipe persisted Firestore
  data from disk.
- [changed] Improved performance for queries with filters that only return a
  small subset of the documents in a collection.
- [fixed] Fixed a race condition between authenticating and initializing
  Firestore that could result in initial writes to the database being dropped.

## 1.4.10

- [changed] Transactions now perform exponential backoff before retrying.
  This means transactions on highly contended documents are more likely to
  succeed.

## 1.4.6

- [changed] Transactions are now more flexible. Some sequences of operations
  that were previously incorrectly disallowed are now allowed. For example,
  after reading a document that doesn't exist, you can now set it multiple
  times successfully in a transaction.

## 1.4.5

- [fixed] Fixed an issue where query results were temporarily missing
  documents that previously had not matched but had been updated to now
  match the query (https://github.com/firebase/firebase-android-sdk/issues/155).

## 1.4.4

- [fixed] Fixed an internal assertion that was triggered when an update
  with a `FieldValue.serverTimestamp()` and an update with a
  `FieldValue.increment()` were pending for the same document.

## 1.4.0

- [changed] Added logging and a custom error message to help users hitting
  https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=197050 (a bug in iOS 12.2 causing
  the SDK to potentially crash when persistence is enabled).
- [fixed] Fixed an issue for environments missing `window.addEventListener`,
  such as in React Native with Expo (#1824).

## 1.3.5

- [feature] Added `clearPersistence()`, which clears the persistent storage
  including pending writes and cached documents. This is intended to help
  write reliable tests (#449).

## 1.3.3

- [changed] Firestore now recovers more quickly after network connectivity
  changes (airplane mode, Wi-Fi availability, etc.).

## 1.3.0

- [changed] Deprecated the `experimentalTabSynchronization` setting in favor of
  `synchronizeTabs`. If you use multi-tab synchronization, it is recommended
  that you update your call to `enablePersistence()`. Firestore logs an error
  if you continue to use `experimentalTabSynchronization`.
- [feature] You can now query across all collections in your database with a
  given collection ID using the `FirebaseFirestore.collectionGroup()` method.

## 1.1.4

- [feature] Added an `experimentalForceLongPolling` setting that that can be
  used to work around proxies that prevent the Firestore client from connecting
  to the Firestore backend.

## 1.1.1

- [changed] Increased a connection timeout that could lead to large writes
  perputually retrying without ever succeeding (#1447).
- [fixed] Fixed an issue with IndexedDb persistence that triggered an internal
  assert for Queries that use nested DocumentReferences in where() clauses
  (#1524, #1596).
- [fixed] Fixed an issue where transactions in a Node.JS app could be sent
  without auth credentials, leading to Permission Denied errors.

## 1.1.0

- [feature] Added `FieldValue.increment()`, which can be used in `update()`
  and `set(..., {merge:true})` to increment or decrement numeric field
  values safely without transactions.
- [changed] Prepared the persistence layer to support collection group queries.
  While this feature is not yet available, all schema changes are included
  in this release. Once you upgrade, you will not be able to use an older version
  of the Firestore SDK with persistence enabled.

## 1.0.5

- [changed] Improved performance when querying over documents that contain
  subcollections.

## 1.0.4

- [fixed] Fixed an uncaught promise error occurring when `enablePersistence()`
  was called in a second tab (#1531).

## 1.0.0

- [changed] The `timestampsInSnapshots` setting is now enabled by default.
  Timestamp fields that read from a `DocumentSnapshot` are now returned as
  `Timestamp` objects instead of `Date` objects. This is a breaking change;
  developers must update any code that expects to receive a `Date` object. See
  https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/firebase.firestore.Settings#~timestampsInSnapshots
  for more details.
- [fixed] Fixed a crash that could happen when the app is shut down after
  a write has been sent to the server but before it has been received on
  a listener.

## 0.9.2

- [fixed] Fixed a regression introduced in 5.7.0 that caused apps using
  experimentalTabSynchronization to hit an exception for "Failed to obtain
  primary lease for action 'Collect garbage'".

## 0.9.1

- [changed] Added a custom error for schema downgrades.

## 0.9.0

- [changed] Removed eval()-based fallback for JSON parsing, allowing SDK to
  be used in environments that prohibit eval().
- [feature] Added a garbage collection process to on-disk persistence that
  removes older documents. This is enabled automatically if persistence is
  enabled, and the SDK will attempt to periodically clean up older, unused
  documents once the on-disk cache passes a threshold size (default: 40 MB).
  This threshold can be configured by changing the setting `cacheSizeBytes` in
  the settings passed to `Firestore.settings()`. It must be set to a minimum of
  1 MB. The garbage collection process can be disabled entirely by setting
  `cacheSizeBytes` to `CACHE_SIZE_UNLIMITED`.

## 0.8.3

- [fixed] Fixed an issue that prevented query synchronization between multiple
  tabs.

## 0.8.2

- [fixed] Fixed an issue where native ES6 module loading was not working.

## 0.8.1

- [fixed] Fixed an issue where typings are created in the wrong location.

## 0.8.0

- [feature] Access to offline persistence is no longer limited to a single tab.
  You can opt into this new experimental mode by invoking `enablePersistence()`
  with `{experimentalTabSynchronization: true}`. All tabs accessing persistence
  must use the same setting for this flag.
- [fixed] Fixed an issue where the first `get()` call made after being offline
  could incorrectly return cached data without attempting to reach the backend.
- [changed] Changed `get()` to only make one attempt to reach the backend before
  returning cached data, potentially reducing delays while offline.
- [fixed] Fixed an issue that caused Firebase to drop empty objects from calls
  to `set(..., { merge: true })`.
- [changed] Improved argument validation for several API methods.

## 0.7.3

- [changed] Changed the internal handling for locally updated documents that
  haven't yet been read back from Firestore. This can lead to slight behavior
  changes and may affect the `SnapshotMetadata.hasPendingWrites` metadata flag.
- [changed] Eliminated superfluous update events for locally cached documents
  that are known to lag behind the server version. Instead, we buffer these
  events until the client has caught up with the server.

## 0.7.2

- [fixed] Fixed a regression that prevented use of Firestore on ReactNative's
  Expo platform (#1138).

## 0.7.0

- [fixed] Fixed `get({source: 'cache'})` to be able to return nonexistent
  documents from cache.
- [changed] Prepared the persistence layer to allow shared access from multiple
  tabs. While this feature is not yet available, all schema changes are included
  in this release. Once you upgrade, you will not be able to use an older version
  of the Firestore SDK with persistence enabled.
- [fixed] Fixed an issue where changes to custom authentication claims did not
  take effect until you did a full sign-out and sign-in.
  (firebase/firebase-ios-sdk#1499)

## 0.6.1

- [changed] Improved how Firestore handles idle queries to reduce the cost of
  re-listening within 30 minutes.
- [changed] Improved offline performance with many outstanding writes.

## 0.6.0

- [fixed] Fixed an issue where queries returned fewer results than they should,
  caused by documents that were cached as deleted when they should not have
  been (firebase/firebase-ios-sdk#1548). Because some cache data is cleared,
  clients might use extra bandwidth the first time they launch with this
  version of the SDK.
- [feature] Added `firebase.firestore.FieldValue.arrayUnion()` and
  `firebase.firestore.FieldValue.arrayRemove()` to atomically add and remove
  elements from an array field in a document.
- [feature] Added `'array-contains'` query operator for use with `.where()` to
  find documents where an array field contains a specific element.

## 0.5.0

- [changed] Merged the `includeQueryMetadataChanges` and
  `includeDocumentMetadataChanges` options passed to `Query.onSnapshot()` into
  a single `includeMetadataChanges` option.
- [changed] `QuerySnapshot.docChanges()` is now a method that optionally takes
  an `includeMetadataChanges` option. By default, even when listening to a query
  with `{ includeMetadataChanges:true }`, metadata-only document changes are
  suppressed in `docChanges()`.
- [feature] Added new `{ mergeFields: (string|FieldPath)[] }` option to `set()`
  which allows merging of a reduced subset of fields.

## 0.4.1

- [fixed] Fixed a regression in Firebase JS release 4.13.0 regarding the
  loading of proto files, causing Node.JS support to break.

## 0.4.0

- [feature] Added a new `Timestamp` class to represent timestamp fields,
  currently supporting up to microsecond precision. It can be passed to API
  methods anywhere a JS Date object is currently accepted. To make
  `DocumentSnapshot`s read timestamp fields back as `Timestamp`s instead of
  Dates, you can set the newly added flag `timestampsInSnapshots` in
  `FirestoreSettings` to `true`. Note that the current behavior
  (`DocumentSnapshot`s returning JS Date objects) will be removed in a future
  release. `Timestamp` supports higher precision than JS Date.
- [feature] Added ability to control whether DocumentReference.get() and
  Query.get() should fetch from server only, (by passing { source: 'server' }),
  cache only (by passing { source: 'cache' }), or attempt server and fall back
  to the cache (which was the only option previously, and is now the default).

## 0.3.7

- [fixed] Fixed a regression in the Firebase JS release 4.11.0 that could
  cause get() requests made while offline to be delayed by up to 10
  seconds (rather than returning from cache immediately).

# 0.3.6

- [fixed] Fixed a regression in the Firebase JS release 4.11.0 that could
  cause a crash if a user signs out while the client is offline, resulting in
  an error of "Attempted to schedule multiple operations with timer id
  listen_stream_connection_backoff".

## 0.3.5

- [changed] If the SDK's attempt to connect to the Cloud Firestore backend
  neither succeeds nor fails within 10 seconds, the SDK will consider itself
  "offline", causing get() calls to resolve with cached results, rather than
  continuing to wait.
- [fixed] Fixed a potential race condition after calling `enableNetwork()` that
  could result in a "Mutation batchIDs must be acknowledged in order" assertion
  crash.

## 0.3.2

- [fixed] Fixed a regression in Firebase JS release 4.9.0 that could in certain
  cases result in an "OnlineState should not affect limbo documents." assertion
  crash when the client loses its network connection.

## 0.3.1

- [changed] Snapshot listeners (with the `includeMetadataChanges` option
  enabled) now receive an event with `snapshot.metadata.fromCache` set to
  `true` if the SDK loses its connection to the backend. A new event with
  `snapshot.metadata.fromCache` set to false will be raised once the
  connection is restored and the query is in sync with the backend again.
- [feature] Added `SnapshotOptions` API to control how DocumentSnapshots
  return unresolved server timestamps.
- [feature] Added `disableNetwork()` and `enableNetwork()` methods to
  `Firestore` class, allowing for explicit network management.
- [changed] For non-existing documents, `DocumentSnapshot.data()` now returns
  `undefined` instead of throwing an exception. A new
  `QueryDocumentSnapshot` class is introduced for Queries to reduce the number
  of undefined-checks in your code.
- [added] Added `isEqual` API to `GeoPoint`, `Blob`, `SnapshotMetadata`,
  `DocumentSnapshot`, `QuerySnapshot`, `CollectionReference`, `FieldValue`
  and `FieldPath`.
- [changed] A "Could not reach Firestore backend." message will be
  logged when the initial connection to the Firestore backend fails.
- [changed] A "Using maximum backoff delay to prevent overloading the
  backend." message will be logged when we get a resource-exhausted
  error from the backend.

## v0.2.1

- [feature] Added Node.js support for Cloud Firestore (with the exception of
  the offline persistence feature).
- [changed] Webchannel requests use \$httpHeaders URL parameter rather than
  normal HTTP headers to avoid an extra CORS preflight request when initiating
  streams / RPCs.

## v0.1.4

- [changed] Network streams are automatically closed after 60 seconds of
  idleness.
- [changed] We no longer log 'RPC failed' messages for expected failures.

## v0.1.2

- [changed] We now support `FieldValue.delete()` sentinels in `set()` calls
  with `{merge:true}`.
- [fixed] Fixed validation of nested arrays to allow indirect nesting

## v0.1.1

- [fixed] Fixed an issue causing exceptions when trying to use
  `firebase.firestore.FieldPath.documentId()` in an `orderBy()` or `where()`
  clause in a query.

## v0.1.0

- Initial public release.
