## waitForPendingWrites() function

Waits until all currently pending writes for the active user have been acknowledged by the backend.

The returned Promise resolves immediately if there are no outstanding writes. Otherwise, the Promise waits for all previously issued writes (including those written in a previous app session), but it does not wait for writes that were added after the function is called. If you want to wait for additional writes, call `waitForPendingWrites()` again.

Any outstanding `waitForPendingWrites()` Promises are rejected during user changes.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function waitForPendingWrites(firestore: FirebaseFirestore): Promise<void>;
```

<b>Returns:</b>
