## Methods

|  Method | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [cancel()](./storage.uploadtask.cancel.md) | Cancels a running task. Has no effect on a complete or failed task. |
|  [catch(onRejected)](./storage.uploadtask.catch.md) | Equivalent to calling <code>then(null, onRejected)</code>. |
|  [on(event, nextOrObserver, error, complete)](./storage.uploadtask.on.md) | Listens for events on this task.<!-- -->Events have three callback functions (referred to as <code>next</code>, <code>error</code>, and <code>complete</code>).<!-- -->If only the event is passed, a function that can be used to register the callbacks is returned. Otherwise, the callbacks are passed after the event.<!-- -->Callbacks can be passed either as three separate arguments <em>or</em> as the <code>next</code>, <code>error</code>, and <code>complete</code> properties of an object. Any of the three callbacks is optional, as long as at least one is specified. In addition, when you add your callbacks, you get a function back. You can call this function to unregister the associated callbacks. |

|  [resume()](./storage.uploadtask.resume.md) | Resumes a paused task. Has no effect on a currently running or failed task. |
|  [then(onFulfilled, onRejected)](./storage.uploadtask.then.md) | This object behaves like a Promise, and resolves with its snapshot data when the upload completes. |
