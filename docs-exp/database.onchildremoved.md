## onChildRemoved() function

Listens for data changes at a particular location.

This is the primary way to read data from a Database. Your callback will be triggered for the initial data and again whenever the data changes. Invoke the returned unsubscribe callback to stop receiving updates. See [Retrieve Data on the Web](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/retrieve-data) for more details.

An `onChildRemoved` event will be triggered once every time a child is removed. The `DataSnapshot` passed into the callback will be the old data for the child that was removed. A child will get removed when either:

- a client explicitly calls `remove()` on that child or one of its ancestors - a client calls `set(null)` on that child or one of its ancestors - that child has all of its children removed - there is a query in effect which now filters out the child (because it's sort order changed or the max limit was hit)

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function onChildRemoved(query: Query, callback: (snapshot: DataSnapshot) => unknown, cancelCallback?: (error: Error) => unknown): Unsubscribe;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  query | [Query](./database.query.md) | The query to run. |
|  callback | (snapshot: [DataSnapshot](./database.datasnapshot.md)<!-- -->) =&gt; unknown | A callback that fires when the specified event occurs. The callback will be passed a DataSnapshot and a string containing the key of the previous child, by sort order, or <code>null</code> if it is the first child. |
|  cancelCallback | (error: Error) =&gt; unknown | An optional callback that will be notified if your event subscription is ever canceled because your client does not have permission to read this data (or it had permission but has now lost it). This callback will be passed an <code>Error</code> object indicating why the failure occurred. |

<b>Returns:</b>

[Unsubscribe](./database.unsubscribe.md)

A function that can be invoked to remove the listener.
