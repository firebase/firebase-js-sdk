## setDoc() function

Writes to the document referred to by the specified `DocumentReference`<!-- -->. If the document does not yet exist, it will be created. If you provide `merge` or `mergeFields`<!-- -->, the provided data can be merged into an existing document.

The result of this write will only be reflected in document reads that occur after the returned Promise resolves. If the client is offline, the write fails. If you would like to see local modifications or buffer writes until the client is online, use the full Firestore SDK.
