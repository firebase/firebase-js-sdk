|  [appVerificationDisabledForTesting](./auth-types.authsettings.appverificationdisabledfortesting.md) | boolean | When set, this property disables app verification for the purpose of testing phone authentication. For this property to take effect, it needs to be set before rendering a reCAPTCHA app verifier. When this is disabled, a mock reCAPTCHA is rendered instead. This is useful for manual testing during development or for automated integration tests.<!-- -->In order to use this feature, you will need to [whitelist your phone number](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/phone-auth#test-with-whitelisted-phone-numbers) via the Firebase Console.<!-- -->The default value is false (app verification is enabled). |
