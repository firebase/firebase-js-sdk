## ActionCodeSettings.android property

Sets the Android package name. This will try to open the link in an android app if it is installed. If `installApp` is passed, it specifies whether to install the Android app if the device supports it and the app is not already installed. If this field is provided without a `packageName`<!-- -->, an error is thrown explaining that the `packageName` must be provided in conjunction with this field. If `minimumVersion` is specified, and an older version of the app is installed, the user is taken to the Play Store to upgrade the app.
