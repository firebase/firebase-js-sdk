## FunctionsErrorCode type

The set of Firebase Functions status codes. The codes are the same at the ones exposed by gRPC here: https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/statuscodes.md

Possible values: - 'cancelled': The operation was cancelled (typically by the caller). - 'unknown': Unknown error or an error from a different error domain. - 'invalid-argument': Client specified an invalid argument. Note that this differs from 'failed-precondition'. 'invalid-argument' indicates arguments that are problematic regardless of the state of the system (e.g. an invalid field name). - 'deadline-exceeded': Deadline expired before operation could complete. For operations that change the state of the system, this error may be returned even if the operation has completed successfully. For example, a successful response from a server could have been delayed long enough for the deadline to expire. - 'not-found': Some requested document was not found. - 'already-exists': Some document that we attempted to create already exists. - 'permission-denied': The caller does not have permission to execute the specified operation. - 'resource-exhausted': Some resource has been exhausted, perhaps a per-user quota, or perhaps the entire file system is out of space. - 'failed-precondition': Operation was rejected because the system is not in a state required for the operation's execution. - 'aborted': The operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency issue like transaction aborts, etc. - 'out-of-range': Operation was attempted past the valid range. - 'unimplemented': Operation is not implemented or not supported/enabled. - 'internal': Internal errors. Means some invariants expected by underlying system has been broken. If you see one of these errors, something is very broken. - 'unavailable': The service is currently unavailable. This is most likely a transient condition and may be corrected by retrying with a backoff. - 'data-loss': Unrecoverable data loss or corruption. - 'unauthenticated': The request does not have valid authentication credentials for the operation.
