## list() function

List items (files) and prefixes (folders) under this storage reference.

List API is only available for Firebase Rules Version 2.

GCS is a key-blob store. Firebase Storage imposes the semantic of '/' delimited folder structure. Refer to GCS's List API if you want to learn more.

To adhere to Firebase Rules's Semantics, Firebase Storage does not support objects whose paths end with "/" or contain two consecutive "/"s. Firebase Storage List API will filter these unsupported objects. list() may fail if there are too many unsupported objects in the bucket.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function list(ref: StorageReference, options?: ListOptions): Promise<ListResult>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  ref | [StorageReference](./storage.storagereference.md) | StorageReference to get list from. |
|  options | [ListOptions](./storage.listoptions.md) | See ListOptions for details. |

<b>Returns:</b>

Promise&lt;[ListResult](./storage.listresult.md)<!-- -->&gt;

A Promise that resolves with the items and prefixes. `prefixes` contains references to sub-folders and `items` contains references to objects in this folder. `nextPageToken` can be used to get the rest of the results.
