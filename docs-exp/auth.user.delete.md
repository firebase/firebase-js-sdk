## User.delete() method

Deletes and signs out the user.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
delete(): Promise<void>;
```
<b>Returns:</b>

Promise&lt;void&gt;

## Remarks

Important: this is a security-sensitive operation that requires the user to have recently signed in. If this requirement isn't met, ask the user to authenticate again and then call one of the reauthentication methods like [reauthenticateWithCredential()](./auth.reauthenticatewithcredential.md)<!-- -->.
