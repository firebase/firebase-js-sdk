## limitToLast() function

Creates a new `QueryConstraint` that is limited to return only the last specified number of children.

The `limitToLast()` method is used to set a maximum number of children to be synced for a given callback. If we set a limit of 100, we will initially only receive up to 100 `child_added` events. If we have fewer than 100 messages stored in our Database, a `child_added` event will fire for each message. However, if we have over 100 messages, we will only receive a `child_added` event for the last 100 ordered messages. As items change, we will receive `child_removed` events for each item that drops out of the active list so that the total number stays at 100.
