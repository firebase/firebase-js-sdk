## push() function

Generates a new child location using a unique key and returns its `Reference`<!-- -->.

This is the most common pattern for adding data to a collection of items.

If you provide a value to `push()`<!-- -->, the value is written to the generated location. If you don't pass a value, nothing is written to the database and the child remains empty (but you can use the `Reference` elsewhere).

The unique keys generated by `push()` are ordered by the current time, so the resulting list of items is chronologically sorted. The keys are also designed to be unguessable (they contain 72 random bits of entropy).

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript

|  value | unknown | Optional value to be written at the generated location. |
