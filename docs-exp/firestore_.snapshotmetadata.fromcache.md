## SnapshotMetadata.fromCache property

True if the snapshot was created from cached data rather than guaranteed up-to-date server data. If your listener has opted into metadata updates (via `SnapshotListenOptions`<!-- -->) you will receive another snapshot with `fromCache` set to false once the client has received up-to-date data from the backend.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
readonly fromCache: boolean;
```
