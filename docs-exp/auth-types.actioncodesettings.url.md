## ActionCodeSettings.url property

Sets the link continue/state URL, which has different meanings in different contexts: - When the link is handled in the web action widgets, this is the deep link in the `continueUrl` query parameter. - When the link is handled in the app directly, this is the continueUrl query parameter in the deep link of the Dynamic Link.
