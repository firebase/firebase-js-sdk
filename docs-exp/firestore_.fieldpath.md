## FieldPath class

A `FieldPath` refers to a field in a document. The path may consist of a single field name (referring to a top-level field in the document), or a list of field names (referring to a nested field in the document).

Create a `FieldPath` by providing field names. If more than one field name is provided, the path will point to a nested field in a document.

<b>Signature:</b>

export declare class FieldPath
