## Classes

|  Class | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [Bytes](./firestore_lite.bytes.md) | An immutable object representing an array of bytes. |
|  [CollectionReference](./firestore_lite.collectionreference.md) | A <code>CollectionReference</code> object can be used for adding documents, getting document references, and querying for documents (using [query()](./firestore_.query.md)<!-- -->). |
|  [DocumentReference](./firestore_lite.documentreference.md) | A <code>DocumentReference</code> refers to a document location in a Firestore database and can be used to write, read, or listen to the location. The document at the referenced location may or may not exist. |
|  [DocumentSnapshot](./firestore_lite.documentsnapshot.md) | A <code>DocumentSnapshot</code> contains data read from a document in your Firestore database. The data can be extracted with <code>.data()</code> or <code>.get(&lt;field&gt;)</code> to get a specific field.<!-- -->For a <code>DocumentSnapshot</code> that points to a non-existing document, any data access will return 'undefined'. You can use the <code>exists()</code> method to explicitly verify a document's existence. |
|  [FieldPath](./firestore_lite.fieldpath.md) | A <code>FieldPath</code> refers to a field in a document. The path may consist of a single field name (referring to a top-level field in the document), or a list of field names (referring to a nested field in the document).<!-- -->Create a <code>FieldPath</code> by providing field names. If more than one field name is provided, the path will point to a nested field in a document. |
|  [FieldValue](./firestore_lite.fieldvalue.md) | Sentinel values that can be used when writing document fields with <code>set()</code> or <code>update()</code>. |
|  [FirebaseFirestore](./firestore_lite.firebasefirestore.md) | The Cloud Firestore service interface.<!-- -->Do not call this constructor directly. Instead, use [getFirestore()](./firestore_.getfirestore.md)<!-- -->. |
|  [FirestoreError](./firestore_lite.firestoreerror.md) | An error returned by a Firestore operation. |
|  [GeoPoint](./firestore_lite.geopoint.md) | An immutable object representing a geographic location in Firestore. The location is represented as latitude/longitude pair.<!-- -->Latitude values are in the range of \[-90, 90\]. Longitude values are in the range of \[-180, 180\]. |
|  [Query](./firestore_lite.query.md) | A <code>Query</code> refers to a Query which you can read or listen to. You can also construct refined <code>Query</code> objects by adding filters and ordering. |
|  [QueryConstraint](./firestore_lite.queryconstraint.md) | A <code>QueryConstraint</code> is used to narrow the set of documents returned by a Firestore query. <code>QueryConstraint</code>s are created by invoking [where()](./firestore_.where.md)<!-- -->, [orderBy()](./firestore_.orderby.md)<!-- -->, , , , , [limit()](./firestore_.limit.md) or [limitToLast()](./firestore_.limittolast.md) and can then be passed to [query()](./firestore_.query.md) to create a new query instance that also contains this <code>QueryConstraint</code>. |
|  [QueryDocumentSnapshot](./firestore_lite.querydocumentsnapshot.md) | A <code>QueryDocumentSnapshot</code> contains data read from a document in your Firestore database as part of a query. The document is guaranteed to exist and its data can be extracted with <code>.data()</code> or <code>.get(&lt;field&gt;)</code> to get a specific field.<!-- -->A <code>QueryDocumentSnapshot</code> offers the same API surface as a <code>DocumentSnapshot</code>. Since query results contain only existing documents, the <code>exists</code> property will always be true and <code>data()</code> will never return 'undefined'. |
|  [QuerySnapshot](./firestore_lite.querysnapshot.md) | A <code>QuerySnapshot</code> contains zero or more <code>DocumentSnapshot</code> objects representing the results of a query. The documents can be accessed as an array via the <code>docs</code> property or enumerated using the <code>forEach</code> method. The number of documents can be determined via the <code>empty</code> and <code>size</code> properties. |
|  [Timestamp](./firestore_lite.timestamp.md) | A <code>Timestamp</code> represents a point in time independent of any time zone or calendar, represented as seconds and fractions of seconds at nanosecond resolution in UTC Epoch time.<!-- -->It is encoded using the Proleptic Gregorian Calendar which extends the Gregorian calendar backwards to year one. It is encoded assuming all minutes are 60 seconds long, i.e. leap seconds are "smeared" so that no leap second table is needed for interpretation. Range is from 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z to 9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z. https://github.com/google/protobuf/blob/master/src/google/protobuf/timestamp.proto |
|  [Transaction](./firestore_lite.transaction.md) | A reference to a transaction.<!-- -->The <code>Transaction</code> object passed to a transaction's <code>updateFunction</code> provides the methods to read and write data within the transaction context. See [runTransaction()](./firestore_.runtransaction.md)<!-- -->. |
|  [WriteBatch](./firestore_lite.writebatch.md) | A write batch, used to perform multiple writes as a single atomic unit.<!-- -->A <code>WriteBatch</code> object can be acquired by calling [writeBatch()](./firestore_.writebatch.md)<!-- -->. It provides methods for adding writes to the write batch. None of the writes will be committed (or visible locally) until  is called. |

## Interfaces

|  Interface | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [DocumentData](./firestore_lite.documentdata.md) | Document data (for use with ) consists of fields mapped to values. |
|  [FirestoreDataConverter](./firestore_lite.firestoredataconverter.md) | Converter used by <code>withConverter()</code> to transform user objects of type <code>T</code> into Firestore data.<!-- -->Using the converter allows you to specify generic type arguments when storing and retrieving objects from Firestore. |
|  [Settings](./firestore_lite.settings.md) |  |
|  [UpdateData](./firestore_lite.updatedata.md) | Update data (for use with ) consists of field paths (e.g. 'foo' or 'foo.baz') mapped to values. Fields that contain dots reference nested fields within the document. |

## Type Aliases

|  Type Alias | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [FirestoreErrorCode](./firestore_lite.firestoreerrorcode.md) | The set of Firestore status codes. The codes are the same at the ones exposed by gRPC here: https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/statuscodes.md<!-- -->Possible values: - 'cancelled': The operation was cancelled (typically by the caller). - 'unknown': Unknown error or an error from a different error domain. - 'invalid-argument': Client specified an invalid argument. Note that this differs from 'failed-precondition'. 'invalid-argument' indicates arguments that are problematic regardless of the state of the system (e.g. an invalid field name). - 'deadline-exceeded': Deadline expired before operation could complete. For operations that change the state of the system, this error may be returned even if the operation has completed successfully. For example, a successful response from a server could have been delayed long enough for the deadline to expire. - 'not-found': Some requested document was not found. - 'already-exists': Some document that we attempted to create already exists. - 'permission-denied': The caller does not have permission to execute the specified operation. - 'resource-exhausted': Some resource has been exhausted, perhaps a per-user quota, or perhaps the entire file system is out of space. - 'failed-precondition': Operation was rejected because the system is not in a state required for the operation's execution. - 'aborted': The operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency issue like transaction aborts, etc. - 'out-of-range': Operation was attempted past the valid range. - 'unimplemented': Operation is not implemented or not supported/enabled. - 'internal': Internal errors. Means some invariants expected by underlying system has been broken. If you see one of these errors, something is very broken. - 'unavailable': The service is currently unavailable. This is most likely a transient condition and may be corrected by retrying with a backoff. - 'data-loss': Unrecoverable data loss or corruption. - 'unauthenticated': The request does not have valid authentication credentials for the operation. |
|  [OrderByDirection](./firestore_lite.orderbydirection.md) | The direction of a [orderBy()](./firestore_.orderby.md) clause is specified as 'desc' or 'asc' (descending or ascending). |
|  [QueryConstraintType](./firestore_lite.queryconstrainttype.md) | Describes the different query constraints available in this SDK. |
|  [SetOptions](./firestore_lite.setoptions.md) | An options object that configures the behavior of ,  and  calls. These calls can be configured to perform granular merges instead of overwriting the target documents in their entirety by providing a <code>SetOptions</code> with <code>merge: true</code>. |
|  [WhereFilterOp](./firestore_lite.wherefilterop.md) | Filter conditions in a [where()](./firestore_.where.md) clause are specified using the strings '&amp;lt;', '&amp;lt;=', '==', '!=', '&amp;gt;=', '&amp;gt;', 'array-contains', 'in', 'array-contains-any', and 'not-in'. |
