## terminate() function

Terminates the provided Firestore instance.

After calling `terminate()` only the `clearIndexedDbPersistence()` functions may be used. Any other function will throw a `FirestoreError`<!-- -->. Termination does not cancel any pending writes, and any promises that are awaiting a response from the server will not be resolved.

To restart after termination, create a new instance of FirebaseFirestore with [getFirestore()](./firestore_.getfirestore.md)<!-- -->.

Note: Under normal circumstances, calling `terminate()` is not required. This function is useful only when you want to force this instance to release all of its resources or in combination with [clearIndexedDbPersistence()](./firestore_.clearindexeddbpersistence.md) to ensure that all local state is destroyed between test runs.

<b>Signature:</b>

<b>Returns:</b>
