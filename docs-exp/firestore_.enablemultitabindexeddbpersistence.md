## enableMultiTabIndexedDbPersistence() function

Attempts to enable multi-tab persistent storage, if possible. If enabled across all tabs, all operations share access to local persistence, including shared execution of queries and latency-compensated local document updates across all connected instances.

If this fails, `enableMultiTabIndexedDbPersistence()` will reject the promise it returns. Note that even after this failure, the `Firestore` instance will remain usable, however offline persistence will be disabled.

There are several reasons why this can fail, which can be identified by the `code` on the error.

\* failed-precondition: The app is already open in another browser tab and multi-tab is not enabled. \* unimplemented: The browser is incompatible with the offline persistence implementation.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function enableMultiTabIndexedDbPersistence(firestore: FirebaseFirestore): Promise<void>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |

|  firestore | [FirebaseFirestore](./firestore_.firebasefirestore.md) | The <code>Firestore</code> instance to enable persistence for. |

<b>Returns:</b>

Promise&lt;void&gt;

A promise that represents successfully enabling persistent storage.
