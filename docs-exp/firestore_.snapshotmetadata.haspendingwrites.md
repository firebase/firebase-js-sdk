## SnapshotMetadata.hasPendingWrites property

True if the snapshot contains the result of local writes (for example `set()` or `update()` calls) that have not yet been committed to the backend. If your listener has opted into metadata updates (via `SnapshotListenOptions`<!-- -->) you will receive another snapshot with `hasPendingWrites` equal to false once the writes have been committed to the backend.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
readonly hasPendingWrites: boolean;
```
