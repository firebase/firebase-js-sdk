## Settings.experimentalForceLongPolling property

Forces the SDKâ€™s underlying network transport (WebChannel) to use long-polling. Each response from the backend will be closed immediately after the backend sends data (by default responses are kept open in case the backend has more data to send). This avoids incompatibility issues with certain proxies, antivirus software, etc. that incorrectly buffer traffic indefinitely. Use of this option will cause some performance degradation though.

This setting cannot be used with `experimentalAutoDetectLongPolling` and may be removed in a future release. If you find yourself using it to work around a specific network reliability issue, please tell us about it in https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/issues/1674.
