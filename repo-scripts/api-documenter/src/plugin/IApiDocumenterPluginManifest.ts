 * An API documenter plugin is an NPM package. By convention, the NPM package name should have the prefix

 * the `IApiDocumenterPluginManifest` interface.
 *
 * For example:
 * ```ts
 * class MyMarkdownDocumenter extends MarkdownDocumenterFeature {
 *   public onInitialized(): void {
 *     console.log('MyMarkdownDocumenter: onInitialized()');
 *   }
 * }
 *
