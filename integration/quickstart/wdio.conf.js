  //
  // ==================
  // Specify Test Files
  // ==================
  // Define which test specs should run. The pattern is relative to the directory
  // from which `wdio` was called. Notice that, if you are calling `wdio` from an
  // NPM script (see https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/run-script) then the current working
  // directory is where your package.json resides, so `wdio` will be called from there.
  //
  specs: [
    './src/**/*.ts'
  ],
  // Patterns to exclude.
  exclude: [
    // 'path/to/excluded/files'
  ],
  //
  // ============
  // Capabilities
  // ============
  // Define your capabilities here. WebdriverIO can run multiple capabilities at the same
  // time. Depending on the number of capabilities, WebdriverIO launches several test
  // sessions. Within your capabilities you can overwrite the spec and exclude options in
  // order to group specific specs to a specific capability.
  //
  // First, you can define how many instances should be started at the same time. Let's
  // say you have 3 different capabilities (Chrome, Firefox, and Safari) and you have
  // set maxInstances to 1; wdio will spawn 3 processes. Therefore, if you have 10 spec
  // files and you set maxInstances to 10, all spec files will get tested at the same time
  // and 30 processes will get spawned. The property handles how many capabilities
  // from the same test should run tests.
  //
  maxInstances: 10,
  //
  // If you have trouble getting all important capabilities together, check out the
  // Sauce Labs platform configurator - a great tool to configure your capabilities:
  // https://docs.saucelabs.com/reference/platforms-configurator
  //
  capabilities: [{
    // maxInstances can get overwritten per capability. So if you have an in-house Selenium
    // grid with only 5 firefox instances available you can make sure that not more than
    // 5 instances get started at a time.
    maxInstances: 5,
    //
    browserName: 'chrome'
  }],
  //
  // ===================
  // Test Configurations
  // ===================
  // Define all options that are relevant for the WebdriverIO instance here
  //
  // By default WebdriverIO commands are executed in a synchronous way using
  // the wdio-sync package. If you still want to run your tests in an async way
  // e.g. using promises you can set the sync option to false.
  sync: true,
  //
  // Level of logging verbosity: silent | verbose | command | data | result | error
  logLevel: 'verbose',
  //
  // Enables colors for log output.
  coloredLogs: true,
  //
  // If you only want to run your tests until a specific amount of tests have failed use
  // bail (default is 0 - don't bail, run all tests).
  bail: 0,
  //
  // Saves a screenshot to a given path if a command fails.
  screenshotPath: './errorShots/',
  //
  // Set a base URL in order to shorten url command calls. If your url parameter starts
  // with "/", then the base url gets prepended.
  baseUrl: 'http://localhost',
  //
  // Default timeout for all waitFor* commands.
  waitforTimeout: 30000,
  //
  // Default timeout in milliseconds for request
  // if Selenium Grid doesn't send response
  connectionRetryTimeout: 90000,
  //
  // Default request retries count
  connectionRetryCount: 3,
  //
  // Initialize the browser instance with a WebdriverIO plugin. The object should have the
  // plugin name as key and the desired plugin options as properties. Make sure you have
  // the plugin installed before running any tests. The following plugins are currently
  // available:
  // WebdriverCSS: https://github.com/webdriverio/webdrivercss
  // WebdriverRTC: https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverrtc
  // Browserevent: https://github.com/webdriverio/browserevent
  // plugins: {

  //         screenWidth: [320,480,640,1024]
  //     },
  //     webdriverrtc: {},
  //     browserevent: {}
  // },
  //
  // Test runner services
  // Services take over a specific job you don't want to take care of. They enhance
  // your test setup with almost no effort. Unlike plugins, they don't add new
  // commands. Instead, they hook themselves up into the test process.

  // =====
  // Hooks
  // =====
  // WebdriverIO provides several hooks you can use to interfere with the test process in order to enhance
  // it and to build services around it. You can either apply a single function or an array of
  // methods to it. If one of them returns with a promise, WebdriverIO will wait until that promise got
  // resolved to continue.
