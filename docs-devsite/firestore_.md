## Functions

|  Function | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  <b>function(app, ...)</b> |
|  [getFirestore(app)](./firestore_.md#getfirestore_cf608e1) | Returns the existing default [Firestore](./firestore_.firestore.md#firestore_class) instance that is associated with the provided [FirebaseApp](./app.firebaseapp.md#firebaseapp_interface)<!-- -->. If no instance exists, initializes a new instance with default settings. |
|  [getFirestore(app, databaseId)](./firestore_.md#getfirestore_48de6cb) | <b><i>(Public Preview)</i></b> Returns the existing named [Firestore](./firestore_.firestore.md#firestore_class) instance that is associated with the provided [FirebaseApp](./app.firebaseapp.md#firebaseapp_interface)<!-- -->. If no instance exists, initializes a new instance with default settings. |
|  [initializeFirestore(app, settings, databaseId)](./firestore_.md#initializefirestore_fc7d200) | Initializes a new instance of [Firestore](./firestore_.firestore.md#firestore_class) with the provided settings. Can only be called before any other function, including [getFirestore()](./firestore_.md#getfirestore)<!-- -->. If the custom settings are empty, this function is equivalent to calling [getFirestore()](./firestore_.md#getfirestore)<!-- -->. |
|  <b>function(firestore, ...)</b> |
|  [clearIndexedDbPersistence(firestore)](./firestore_.md#clearindexeddbpersistence_231a8e0) | Clears the persistent storage. This includes pending writes and cached documents.<!-- -->Must be called while the [Firestore](./firestore_.firestore.md#firestore_class) instance is not started (after the app is terminated or when the app is first initialized). On startup, this function must be called before other functions (other than [initializeFirestore()](./firestore_.md#initializefirestore_fc7d200) or [getFirestore()](./firestore_.md#getfirestore)<!-- -->)). If the [Firestore](./firestore_.firestore.md#firestore_class) instance is still running, the promise will be rejected with the error code of <code>failed-precondition</code>.<!-- -->Note: <code>clearIndexedDbPersistence()</code> is primarily intended to help write reliable tests that use Cloud Firestore. It uses an efficient mechanism for dropping existing data but does not attempt to securely overwrite or otherwise make cached data unrecoverable. For applications that are sensitive to the disclosure of cached data in between user sessions, we strongly recommend not enabling persistence at all. |
|  [collection(firestore, path, pathSegments)](./firestore_.md#collection_1eb4c23) | Gets a <code>CollectionReference</code> instance that refers to the collection at the specified absolute path. |
|  [collectionGroup(firestore, collectionId)](./firestore_.md#collectiongroup_1838fc3) | Creates and returns a new <code>Query</code> instance that includes all documents in the database that are contained in a collection or subcollection with the given <code>collectionId</code>. |
|  [connectFirestoreEmulator(firestore, host, port, options)](./firestore_.md#connectfirestoreemulator_7c247cd) | Modify this instance to communicate with the Cloud Firestore emulator.<!-- -->Note: This must be called before this instance has been used to do any operations. |
|  [disableNetwork(firestore)](./firestore_.md#disablenetwork_231a8e0) | Disables network usage for this instance. It can be re-enabled via [enableNetwork()](./firestore_.md#enablenetwork_231a8e0)<!-- -->. While the network is disabled, any snapshot listeners, <code>getDoc()</code> or <code>getDocs()</code> calls will return results from cache, and any write operations will be queued until the network is restored. |
|  [doc(firestore, path, pathSegments)](./firestore_.md#doc_1eb4c23) | Gets a <code>DocumentReference</code> instance that refers to the document at the specified absolute path. |
|  [enableIndexedDbPersistence(firestore, persistenceSettings)](./firestore_.md#enableindexeddbpersistence_224174f) | Attempts to enable persistent storage, if possible.<!-- -->On failure, <code>enableIndexedDbPersistence()</code> will reject the promise or throw an exception. There are several reasons why this can fail, which can be identified by the <code>code</code> on the error.<!-- -->\* failed-precondition: The app is already open in another browser tab. \* unimplemented: The browser is incompatible with the offline persistence implementation.<!-- -->Note that even after a failure, the [Firestore](./firestore_.firestore.md#firestore_class) instance will remain usable, however offline persistence will be disabled.<!-- -->Note: <code>enableIndexedDbPersistence()</code> must be called before any other functions (other than [initializeFirestore()](./firestore_.md#initializefirestore_fc7d200)<!-- -->, [getFirestore()](./firestore_.md#getfirestore) or [clearIndexedDbPersistence()](./firestore_.md#clearindexeddbpersistence_231a8e0)<!-- -->.<!-- -->Persistence cannot be used in a Node.js environment. |
|  [enableMultiTabIndexedDbPersistence(firestore)](./firestore_.md#enablemultitabindexeddbpersistence_231a8e0) | Attempts to enable multi-tab persistent storage, if possible. If enabled across all tabs, all operations share access to local persistence, including shared execution of queries and latency-compensated local document updates across all connected instances.<!-- -->On failure, <code>enableMultiTabIndexedDbPersistence()</code> will reject the promise or throw an exception. There are several reasons why this can fail, which can be identified by the <code>code</code> on the error.<!-- -->\* failed-precondition: The app is already open in another browser tab and multi-tab is not enabled. \* unimplemented: The browser is incompatible with the offline persistence implementation.<!-- -->Note that even after a failure, the [Firestore](./firestore_.firestore.md#firestore_class) instance will remain usable, however offline persistence will be disabled. |
|  [enableNetwork(firestore)](./firestore_.md#enablenetwork_231a8e0) | Re-enables use of the network for this [Firestore](./firestore_.firestore.md#firestore_class) instance after a prior call to [disableNetwork()](./firestore_.md#disablenetwork_231a8e0)<!-- -->. |
|  [getPersistentCacheIndexManager(firestore)](./firestore_.md#getpersistentcacheindexmanager_231a8e0) | Returns the PersistentCache Index Manager used by the given <code>Firestore</code> object.

|  [namedQuery(firestore, name)](./firestore_.md#namedquery_6438876) | Reads a Firestore [Query](./firestore_.query.md#query_class) from local cache, identified by the given name.<!-- -->The named queries are packaged into bundles on the server side (along with resulting documents), and loaded to local cache using <code>loadBundle</code>. Once in local cache, use this method to extract a [Query](./firestore_.query.md#query_class) by name. |
|  [onSnapshotsInSync(firestore, observer)](./firestore_.md#onsnapshotsinsync_2f0dfa4) | Attaches a listener for a snapshots-in-sync event. The snapshots-in-sync event indicates that all listeners affected by a given change have fired, even if a single server-generated change affects multiple listeners.<!-- -->NOTE: The snapshots-in-sync event only indicates that listeners are in sync with each other, but does not relate to whether those snapshots are in sync with the server. Use SnapshotMetadata in the individual listeners to determine if a snapshot is from the cache or the server. |
|  [onSnapshotsInSync(firestore, onSync)](./firestore_.md#onsnapshotsinsync_1901c06) | Attaches a listener for a snapshots-in-sync event. The snapshots-in-sync event indicates that all listeners affected by a given change have fired, even if a single server-generated change affects multiple listeners.<!-- -->NOTE: The snapshots-in-sync event only indicates that listeners are in sync with each other, but does not relate to whether those snapshots are in sync with the server. Use <code>SnapshotMetadata</code> in the individual listeners to determine if a snapshot is from the cache or the server. |
|  [runTransaction(firestore, updateFunction, options)](./firestore_.md#runtransaction_6f03ec4) | Executes the given <code>updateFunction</code> and then attempts to commit the changes applied within the transaction. If any document read within the transaction has changed, Cloud Firestore retries the <code>updateFunction</code>. If it fails to commit after 5 attempts, the transaction fails.<!-- -->The maximum number of writes allowed in a single transaction is 500. |
|  [setIndexConfiguration(firestore, configuration)](./firestore_.md#setindexconfiguration_c362f04) | <b><i>(Public Preview)</i></b> Configures indexing for local query execution. Any previous index configuration is overridden. The <code>Promise</code> resolves once the index configuration has been persisted.<!-- -->The index entries themselves are created asynchronously. You can continue to use queries that require indexing even if the indices are not yet available. Query execution will automatically start using the index once the index entries have been written.<!-- -->Indexes are only supported with IndexedDb persistence. If IndexedDb is not enabled, any index configuration is ignored. |
|  [setIndexConfiguration(firestore, json)](./firestore_.md#setindexconfiguration_90d0285) | <b><i>(Public Preview)</i></b> Configures indexing for local query execution. Any previous index configuration is overridden. The <code>Promise</code> resolves once the index configuration has been persisted.<!-- -->The index entries themselves are created asynchronously. You can continue to use queries that require indexing even if the indices are not yet available. Query execution will automatically start using the index once the index entries have been written.<!-- -->Indexes are only supported with IndexedDb persistence. Invoke either <code>enableIndexedDbPersistence()</code> or <code>enableMultiTabIndexedDbPersistence()</code> before setting an index configuration. If IndexedDb is not enabled, any index configuration is ignored.<!-- -->The method accepts the JSON format exported by the Firebase CLI (<code>firebase firestore:indexes</code>). If the JSON format is invalid, this method throws an error. |
|  [terminate(firestore)](./firestore_.md#terminate_231a8e0) | Terminates the provided [Firestore](./firestore_.firestore.md#firestore_class) instance.<!-- -->After calling <code>terminate()</code> only the <code>clearIndexedDbPersistence()</code> function may be used. Any other function will throw a <code>FirestoreError</code>.<!-- -->To restart after termination, create a new instance of FirebaseFirestore with [getFirestore()](./firestore_.md#getfirestore)<!-- -->.<!-- -->Termination does not cancel any pending writes, and any promises that are awaiting a response from the server will not be resolved. If you have persistence enabled, the next time you start this instance, it will resume sending these writes to the server.<!-- -->Note: Under normal circumstances, calling <code>terminate()</code> is not required. This function is useful only when you want to force this instance to release all of its resources or in combination with <code>clearIndexedDbPersistence()</code> to ensure that all local state is destroyed between test runs. |
|  [waitForPendingWrites(firestore)](./firestore_.md#waitforpendingwrites_231a8e0) | Waits until all currently pending writes for the active user have been acknowledged by the backend.<!-- -->The returned promise resolves immediately if there are no outstanding writes. Otherwise, the promise waits for all previously issued writes (including those written in a previous app session), but it does not wait for writes that were added after the function is called. If you want to wait for additional writes, call <code>waitForPendingWrites()</code> again.<!-- -->Any outstanding <code>waitForPendingWrites()</code> promises are rejected during user changes. |
|  [writeBatch(firestore)](./firestore_.md#writebatch_231a8e0) | Creates a write batch, used for performing multiple writes as a single atomic operation. The maximum number of writes allowed in a single [WriteBatch](./firestore_.writebatch.md#writebatch_class) is 500.<!-- -->Unlike transactions, write batches are persisted offline and therefore are preferable when you don't need to condition your writes on read data. |

## Interfaces

|  Interface | Description |

|  [DocumentChange](./firestore_.documentchange.md#documentchange_interface) | A <code>DocumentChange</code> represents a change to the documents matching a query. It contains the document affected and the type of change that occurred. |
|  [DocumentData](./firestore_.documentdata.md#documentdata_interface) | Document data (for use with [setDoc()](./firestore_lite.md#setdoc_ee215ad)<!-- -->) consists of fields mapped to values. |
|  [ExperimentalLongPollingOptions](./firestore_.experimentallongpollingoptions.md#experimentallongpollingoptions_interface) | Options that configure the SDK’s underlying network transport (WebChannel) when long-polling is used.<!-- -->Note: This interface is "experimental" and is subject to change.<!-- -->See <code>FirestoreSettings.experimentalAutoDetectLongPolling</code>, <code>FirestoreSettings.experimentalForceLongPolling</code>, and <code>FirestoreSettings.experimentalLongPollingOptions</code>. |
|  [FirestoreDataConverter](./firestore_.firestoredataconverter.md#firestoredataconverter_interface) | Converter used by <code>withConverter()</code> to transform user objects of type <code>AppModelType</code> into Firestore data of type <code>DbModelType</code>.<!-- -->Using the converter allows you to specify generic type arguments when storing and retrieving objects from Firestore.<!-- -->In this context, an "AppModel" is a class that is used in an application to package together related information and functionality. Such a class could, for example, have properties with complex, nested data types, properties used for memoization, properties of types not supported by Firestore (such as <code>symbol</code> and <code>bigint</code>), and helper functions that perform compound operations. Such classes are not suitable and/or possible to store into a Firestore database. Instead, instances of such classes need to be converted to "plain old JavaScript objects" (POJOs) with exclusively primitive properties, potentially nested inside other POJOs or arrays of POJOs. In this context, this type is referred to as the "DbModel" and would be an object suitable for persisting into Firestore. For convenience, applications can implement <code>FirestoreDataConverter</code> and register the converter with Firestore objects, such as <code>DocumentReference</code> or <code>Query</code>, to automatically convert <code>AppModel</code> to <code>DbModel</code> when storing into Firestore, and convert <code>DbModel</code> to <code>AppModel</code> when retrieving from Firestore. |

|  [LoadBundleTaskProgress](./firestore_.loadbundletaskprogress.md#loadbundletaskprogress_interface) | Represents a progress update or a final state from loading bundles. |
|  [PersistenceSettings](./firestore_.persistencesettings.md#persistencesettings_interface) | Settings that can be passed to <code>enableIndexedDbPersistence()</code> to configure Firestore persistence.<!-- -->Persistence cannot be used in a Node.js environment. |
|  [SnapshotListenOptions](./firestore_.snapshotlistenoptions.md#snapshotlistenoptions_interface) | An options object that can be passed to [onSnapshot()](./firestore_.md#onsnapshot_0312fd7) and [QuerySnapshot.docChanges()](./firestore_.querysnapshot.md#querysnapshotdocchanges) to control which types of changes to include in the result set. |

Note that this differs from 'failed-precondition'. 'invalid-argument' indicates arguments that are problematic regardless of the state of the system (e.g. an invalid field name). - 'deadline-exceeded': Deadline expired before operation could complete. For operations that change the state of the system, this error may be returned even if the operation has completed successfully. For example, a successful response from a server could have been delayed long enough for the deadline to expire. - 'not-found': Some requested document was not found. - 'already-exists': Some document that we attempted to create already exists. - 'permission-denied': The caller does not have permission to execute the specified operation. - 'resource-exhausted': Some resource has been exhausted, perhaps a per-user quota, or perhaps the entire file system is out of space. - 'failed-precondition': Operation was rejected because the system is not in a state required for the operation's execution. - 'aborted': The operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency issue like transaction aborts, etc. - 'out-of-range': Operation was attempted past the valid range. - 'unimplemented': Operation is not implemented or not supported/enabled. - 'internal': Internal errors. Means some invariants expected by underlying system has been broken. If you see one of these errors, something is very broken. - 'unavailable': The service is currently unavailable. This is most likely a transient condition and may be corrected by retrying with a backoff. - 'data-loss': Unrecoverable data loss or corruption. - 'unauthenticated': The request does not have valid authentication credentials for the operation. |

The named [Firestore](./firestore_.firestore.md#firestore_class) instance of the provided app.

### initializeFirestore(app, settings, databaseId) {:#initializefirestore_fc7d200}

Initializes a new instance of [Firestore](./firestore_.firestore.md#firestore_class) with the provided settings. Can only be called before any other function, including [getFirestore()](./firestore_.md#getfirestore)<!-- -->. If the custom settings are empty, this function is equivalent to calling [getFirestore()](./firestore_.md#getfirestore)<!-- -->.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function initializeFirestore(app: FirebaseApp, settings: FirestoreSettings, databaseId?: string): Firestore;
```

#### Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |

## function(firestore, ...)

### clearIndexedDbPersistence(firestore) {:#clearindexeddbpersistence_231a8e0}

Clears the persistent storage. This includes pending writes and cached documents.

Must be called while the [Firestore](./firestore_.firestore.md#firestore_class) instance is not started (after the app is terminated or when the app is first initialized). On startup, this function must be called before other functions (other than [initializeFirestore()](./firestore_.md#initializefirestore_fc7d200) or [getFirestore()](./firestore_.md#getfirestore)<!-- -->)). If the [Firestore](./firestore_.firestore.md#firestore_class) instance is still running, the promise will be rejected with the error code of `failed-precondition`<!-- -->.

Note: `clearIndexedDbPersistence()` is primarily intended to help write reliable tests that use Cloud Firestore. It uses an efficient mechanism for dropping existing data but does not attempt to securely overwrite or otherwise make cached data unrecoverable. For applications that are sensitive to the disclosure of cached data in between user sessions, we strongly recommend not enabling persistence at all.

> 

Attempts to enable persistent storage, if possible.

On failure, `enableIndexedDbPersistence()` will reject the promise or throw an exception. There are several reasons why this can fail, which can be identified by the `code` on the error.

\* failed-precondition: The app is already open in another browser tab. \* unimplemented: The browser is incompatible with the offline persistence implementation.

Note that even after a failure, the [Firestore](./firestore_.firestore.md#firestore_class) instance will remain usable, however offline persistence will be disabled.

Note: `enableIndexedDbPersistence()` must be called before any other functions (other than [initializeFirestore()](./firestore_.md#initializefirestore_fc7d200)<!-- -->, [getFirestore()](./firestore_.md#getfirestore) or [clearIndexedDbPersistence()](./firestore_.md#clearindexeddbpersistence_231a8e0)<!-- -->.

> 
> Instead of creating cache indexes manually, consider using `enablePersistentCacheIndexAutoCreation()` to let the SDK decide whether to create cache indexes for queries running locally.
> 

Configures indexing for local query execution. Any previous index configuration is overridden. The `Promise` resolves once the index configuration has been persisted.

The index entries themselves are created asynchronously. You can continue to use queries that require indexing even if the indices are not yet available. Query execution will automatically start using the index once the index entries have been written.

Indexes are only supported with IndexedDb persistence. If IndexedDb is not enabled, any index configuration is ignored.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function setIndexConfiguration(firestore: Firestore, configuration: IndexConfiguration): Promise<void>;
```

#### Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  firestore | [Firestore](./firestore_.firestore.md#firestore_class) | The [Firestore](./firestore_.firestore.md#firestore_class) instance to configure indexes for. |
|  configuration | [IndexConfiguration](./firestore_.indexconfiguration.md#indexconfiguration_interface) | The index definition. |

<b>Returns:</b>

Promise&lt;void&gt;

A `Promise` that resolves once all indices are successfully configured.

#### Exceptions

FirestoreError if the JSON format is invalid.

### setIndexConfiguration(firestore, json) {:#setindexconfiguration_90d0285}

> This API is provided as a preview for developers and may change based on feedback that we receive. Do not use this API in a production environment.
> 

> Warning: This API is now obsolete.
> 
> Instead of creating cache indexes manually, consider using `enablePersistentCacheIndexAutoCreation()` to let the SDK decide whether to create cache indexes for queries running locally.
> 

Configures indexing for local query execution. Any previous index configuration is overridden. The `Promise` resolves once the index configuration has been persisted.

The index entries themselves are created asynchronously. You can continue to use queries that require indexing even if the indices are not yet available. Query execution will automatically start using the index once the index entries have been written.

Indexes are only supported with IndexedDb persistence. Invoke either `enableIndexedDbPersistence()` or `enableMultiTabIndexedDbPersistence()` before setting an index configuration. If IndexedDb is not enabled, any index configuration is ignored.

The method accepts the JSON format exported by the Firebase CLI (`firebase firestore:indexes`<!-- -->). If the JSON format is invalid, this method throws an error.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function setIndexConfiguration(firestore: Firestore, json: string): Promise<void>;
```

#### Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  firestore | [Firestore](./firestore_.firestore.md#firestore_class) | The [Firestore](./firestore_.firestore.md#firestore_class) instance to configure indexes for. |
|  json | string | The JSON format exported by the Firebase CLI. |

Promise&lt;void&gt;

A `Promise` that resolves once all indices are successfully configured.

#### Exceptions

FirestoreError if the JSON format is invalid.

### terminate(firestore) {:#terminate_231a8e0}

Terminates the provided [Firestore](./firestore_.firestore.md#firestore_class) instance.

After calling `terminate()` only the `clearIndexedDbPersistence()` function may be used. Any other function will throw a `FirestoreError`<!-- -->.

To restart after termination, create a new instance of FirebaseFirestore with [getFirestore()](./firestore_.md#getfirestore)<!-- -->.

Termination does not cancel any pending writes, and any promises that are awaiting a response from the server will not be resolved. If you have persistence enabled, the next time you start this instance, it will resume sending these writes to the server.

Note: Under normal circumstances, calling `terminate()` is not required. This function is useful only when you want to force this instance to release all of its resources or in combination with `clearIndexedDbPersistence()` to ensure that all local state is destroyed between test runs.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function terminate(firestore: Firestore): Promise<void>;
```

#### Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  firestore | [Firestore](./firestore_.firestore.md#firestore_class) |  |

<b>Returns:</b>

Promise&lt;void&gt;

A `Promise` that is resolved when the instance has been successfully terminated.

### waitForPendingWrites(firestore) {:#waitforpendingwrites_231a8e0}

Waits until all currently pending writes for the active user have been acknowledged by the backend.

The returned promise resolves immediately if there are no outstanding writes. Otherwise, the promise waits for all previously issued writes (including those written in a previous app session), but it does not wait for writes that were added after the function is called. If you want to wait for additional writes, call `waitForPendingWrites()` again.

Any outstanding `waitForPendingWrites()` promises are rejected during user changes.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function waitForPendingWrites(firestore: Firestore): Promise<void>;
```

#### Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  firestore | [Firestore](./firestore_.firestore.md#firestore_class) |  |

<b>Returns:</b>

Promise&lt;void&gt;

A `Promise` which resolves when all currently pending writes have been acknowledged by the backend.

### writeBatch(firestore) {:#writebatch_231a8e0}

Creates a write batch, used for performing multiple writes as a single atomic operation. The maximum number of writes allowed in a single [WriteBatch](./firestore_.writebatch.md#writebatch_class) is 500.

Unlike transactions, write batches are persisted offline and therefore are preferable when you don't need to condition your writes on read data.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function writeBatch(firestore: Firestore): WriteBatch;
```

#### Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  firestore | [Firestore](./firestore_.firestore.md#firestore_class) |  |

Returns a special value that can be used with [setDoc()](./firestore_lite.md#setdoc_ee215ad) or [updateDoc()](./firestore_lite.md#updatedoc_51a65e3) that tells the server to increment the field's current value by the given value.

If either the operand or the current field value uses floating point precision, all arithmetic follows IEEE 754 semantics. If both values are integers, values outside of JavaScript's safe number range (`Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER` to `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`<!-- -->) are also subject to precision loss. Furthermore, once processed by the Firestore backend, all integer operations are capped between -2^63 and 2^63-1.

If the current field value is not of type `number`<!-- -->, or if the field does not yet exist, the transformation sets the field to the given value.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function increment(n: number): FieldValue;
```

#### Parameters

|  --- | --- | --- |
|  n | number | The value to increment by. |

## function(query, ...)

### getAggregateFromServer(query, aggregateSpec) {:#getaggregatefromserver_2073a74}

Calculates the specified aggregations over the documents in the result set of the given query without actually downloading the documents.

Using this function to perform aggregations is efficient because only the final aggregation values, not the documents' data, are downloaded. This function can perform aggregations of the documents in cases where the result set is prohibitively large to download entirely (thousands of documents).

The result received from the server is presented, unaltered, without considering any local state. That is, documents in the local cache are not taken into consideration, neither are local modifications not yet synchronized with the server. Previously-downloaded results, if any, are not used. Every invocation of this function necessarily involves a round trip to the server.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function getAggregateFromServer<AggregateSpecType extends AggregateSpec, AppModelType, DbModelType extends DocumentData>(query: Query<AppModelType, DbModelType>, aggregateSpec: AggregateSpecType): Promise<AggregateQuerySnapshot<AggregateSpecType, AppModelType, DbModelType>>;
```

#### Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  query | [Query](./firestore_.query.md#query_class)<!-- -->&lt;AppModelType, DbModelType&gt; | The query whose result set is aggregated over. |
|  aggregateSpec | AggregateSpecType | An <code>AggregateSpec</code> object that specifies the aggregates to perform over the result set. The AggregateSpec specifies aliases for each aggregate, which can be used to retrieve the aggregate result. |

<b>Returns:</b>

Promise&lt;[AggregateQuerySnapshot](./firestore_.aggregatequerysnapshot.md#aggregatequerysnapshot_class)<!-- -->&lt;AggregateSpecType, AppModelType, DbModelType&gt;&gt;

### Example


```typescript
const aggregateSnapshot = await getAggregateFromServer(query, {
  countOfDocs: count(),
  totalHours: sum('hours'),
  averageScore: average('score')
});

const countOfDocs: number = aggregateSnapshot.data().countOfDocs;
const totalHours: number = aggregateSnapshot.data().totalHours;
const averageScore: number | null = aggregateSnapshot.data().averageScore;

```

### getCountFromServer(query) {:#getcountfromserver_4e56953}

Calculates the number of documents in the result set of the given query without actually downloading the documents.

Using this function to count the documents is efficient because only the final count, not the documents' data, is downloaded. This function can count the documents in cases where the result set is prohibitively large to download entirely (thousands of documents).

The result received from the server is presented, unaltered, without considering any local state. That is, documents in the local cache are not taken into consideration, neither are local modifications not yet synchronized with the server. Previously-downloaded results, if any, are not used. Every invocation of this function necessarily involves a round trip to the server.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function getCountFromServer<AppModelType, DbModelType extends DocumentData>(query: Query<AppModelType, DbModelType>): Promise<AggregateQuerySnapshot<{
    count: AggregateField<number>;
}, AppModelType, DbModelType>>;
```

#### Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  query | [Query](./firestore_.query.md#query_class)<!-- -->&lt;AppModelType, DbModelType&gt; | The query whose result set size is calculated. |

<b>Returns:</b>

Promise&lt;[AggregateQuerySnapshot](./firestore_.aggregatequerysnapshot.md#aggregatequerysnapshot_class)<!-- -->&lt;{ count: [AggregateField](./firestore_.aggregatefield.md#aggregatefield_class)<!-- -->&lt;number&gt;; }, AppModelType, DbModelType&gt;&gt;

A Promise that will be resolved with the count; the count can be retrieved from `snapshot.data().count`<!-- -->, where `snapshot` is the `AggregateQuerySnapshot` to which the returned Promise resolves.

### getDocs(query) {:#getdocs_4e56953}

Executes the query and returns the results as a `QuerySnapshot`<!-- -->.

Note: `getDocs()` attempts to provide up-to-date data when possible by waiting for data from the server, but it may return cached data or fail if you are offline and the server cannot be reached. To specify this behavior, invoke [getDocsFromCache()](./firestore_.md#getdocsfromcache_4e56953) or [getDocsFromServer()](./firestore_.md#getdocsfromserver_4e56953)<!-- -->.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function getDocs<AppModelType, DbModelType extends DocumentData>(query: Query<AppModelType, DbModelType>): Promise<QuerySnapshot<AppModelType, DbModelType>>;
```

#### Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |

## FirestoreErrorCode

The set of Firestore status codes. The codes are the same at the ones exposed by gRPC here: https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/statuscodes.md

Possible values: - 'cancelled': The operation was cancelled (typically by the caller). - 'unknown': Unknown error or an error from a different error domain. - 'invalid-argument': Client specified an invalid argument. Note that this differs from 'failed-precondition'. 'invalid-argument' indicates arguments that are problematic regardless of the state of the system (e.g. an invalid field name). - 'deadline-exceeded': Deadline expired before operation could complete. For operations that change the state of the system, this error may be returned even if the operation has completed successfully. For example, a successful response from a server could have been delayed long enough for the deadline to expire. - 'not-found': Some requested document was not found. - 'already-exists': Some document that we attempted to create already exists. - 'permission-denied': The caller does not have permission to execute the specified operation. - 'resource-exhausted': Some resource has been exhausted, perhaps a per-user quota, or perhaps the entire file system is out of space. - 'failed-precondition': Operation was rejected because the system is not in a state required for the operation's execution. - 'aborted': The operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency issue like transaction aborts, etc. - 'out-of-range': Operation was attempted past the valid range. - 'unimplemented': Operation is not implemented or not supported/enabled. - 'internal': Internal errors. Means some invariants expected by underlying system has been broken. If you see one of these errors, something is very broken. - 'unavailable': The service is currently unavailable. This is most likely a transient condition and may be corrected by retrying with a backoff. - 'data-loss': Unrecoverable data loss or corruption. - 'unauthenticated': The request does not have valid authentication credentials for the operation.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type FirestoreErrorCode = 'cancelled' | 'unknown' | 'invalid-argument' | 'deadline-exceeded' | 'not-found' | 'already-exists' | 'permission-denied' | 'resource-exhausted' | 'failed-precondition' | 'aborted' | 'out-of-range' | 'unimplemented' | 'internal' | 'unavailable' | 'data-loss' | 'unauthenticated';

};
```

## MemoryEagerGarbageCollector

A garbage collector deletes documents whenever they are not part of any active queries, and have no local mutations attached to them.

```typescript
export declare type MemoryEagerGarbageCollector = {
    kind: 'memoryEager';
};

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type MemoryLocalCache = {
    kind: 'memory';
};
```

## MemoryLruGarbageCollector

A garbage collector deletes Least-Recently-Used documents in multiple batches.

This collector is configured with a target size, and will only perform collection when the cached documents exceed the target size. It avoids querying backend repeated for the same query or document, at the risk of having a larger memory footprint.

Use factory function  to create a instance of this collector.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type MemoryLruGarbageCollector = {
    kind: 'memoryLru';
};
```

## NestedUpdateFields

export declare type PersistentLocalCache = {
    kind: 'persistent';
};
```

## PersistentMultipleTabManager

    kind: 'persistentSingleTab';
};
```

## PersistentSingleTabManagerSettings

Type to configure an `PersistentSingleTabManager` instance.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type QueryFilterConstraint = QueryFieldFilterConstraint | QueryCompositeFilterConstraint;
```

## QueryNonFilterConstraint

`QueryNonFilterConstraint` is a helper union type that represents QueryConstraints which are used to narrow or order the set of documents, but that do not explicitly filter on a document field. `QueryNonFilterConstraint`<!-- -->s are created by invoking [orderBy()](./firestore_.md#orderby_006d61f)<!-- -->, [startAt()](./firestore_.md#startat_9a4477f)<!-- -->, [startAfter()](./firestore_.md#startafter_9a4477f)<!-- -->, [endBefore()](./firestore_.md#endbefore_9a4477f)<!-- -->, [endAt()](./firestore_.md#endat_9a4477f)<!-- -->, [limit()](./firestore_.md#limit_ec46c78) or [limitToLast()](./firestore_.md#limittolast_ec46c78) and can then be passed to [query()](./firestore_.md#query_9f7b0f4) to create a new query instance that also contains the `QueryConstraint`<!-- -->.

export declare type TaskState = 'Error' | 'Running' | 'Success';
```

## UnionToIntersection

Given a union type `U = T1 | T2 | ...`<!-- -->, returns an intersected type `(T1 & T2 & ...)`<!-- -->.

Uses distributive conditional types and inference from conditional types. This works because multiple candidates for the same type variable in contra-variant positions causes an intersection type to be inferred. https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html\#type-inference-in-conditional-types https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50374908/transform-union-type-to-intersection-type

    [K in keyof T]?: UpdateData<T[K]> | FieldValue;
} & NestedUpdateFields<T> : Partial<T>;
```

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type WhereFilterOp = '<' | '<=' | '==' | '!=' | '>=' | '>' | 'array-contains' | 'in' | 'array-contains-any' | 'not-in';
```

    [K in keyof T]: WithFieldValue<T[K]> | FieldValue;
} : never);
```
