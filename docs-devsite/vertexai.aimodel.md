# AIModel class
Base class for Firebase AI model APIs.

Instances of this class are associated with a specific Firebase AI backend (either the Vertex AI Gemini API or the Gemini Developer API via Google AI) and provide methods for interacting with the configured generative model.

The constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or create subclasses that extend the `AIModel` class.

```typescript
export declare abstract class AIModel 
```
