# ExperimentalLongPollingOptions interface
Options that configure the SDKâ€™s underlying network transport (WebChannel) when long-polling is used.

See `FirestoreSettings.experimentalAutoDetectLongPolling`<!-- -->, `FirestoreSettings.experimentalForceLongPolling`<!-- -->, and `FirestoreSettings.experimentalLongPollingOptions`<!-- -->.

## ExperimentalLongPollingOptions.timeoutSeconds

The desired maximum timeout interval, in seconds, to complete a long-polling GET response. Valid values are between 5 and 30, inclusive. Floating point values are allowed and will be rounded to the nearest millisecond.

By default, when long-polling is used the "hanging GET" request sent by the client times out after 30 seconds. To request a different timeout from the server, set this setting with the desired timeout.

Changing the default timeout may be useful, for example, if the buffering proxy that necessitated enabling long-polling in the first place has a shorter timeout for hanging GET requests, in which case setting the long-polling timeout to a shorter value, such as 25 seconds, may fix prematurely-closed hanging GET requests. For example, see https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/issues/6987.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
timeoutSeconds?: number;
```
