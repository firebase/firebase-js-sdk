# FirebaseServerApp interface
A [FirebaseServerApp](./app.firebaseserverapp.md#firebaseserverapp_interface) holds the initialization information for a collection of services running in server enviornments.

Do not call this constructor directly. Instead, use  to create an app.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export interface FirebaseServerApp extends FirebaseApp 
```
<b>Extends:</b> [FirebaseApp](./app.firebaseapp.md#firebaseapp_interface)

## FirebaseServerApp.appCheckTokenVerified

Checks to see if the verification of the appCheckToken provided to  has completed. If the optional appCheckToken parameter was omitted then the returned Promise is completed immediately.

It is recommend that your application awaits this promise before initializing any Firebase products that use AppCheck. The Firebase SDKs will not use App Check tokens that are determined to be invalid or those that have not yet completed validation.

The returned Promise is completed immediately if the optional appCheckToken parameter was omitted from FirebaseServerApp initialization.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
appCheckTokenVerified: () => Promise<void>;
```

## FirebaseServerApp.authIdTokenVerified

Checks to see if the verification of the authIdToken provided to  has completed.

It is recommend that your application awaits this promise if an authIdToken was provided during FirebaseServerApp initialization before invoking getAuth(). If an instance of Auth is created before the Auth ID Token is validated, then the token will not be used by that instance of the Auth SDK.

The returned Promise is completed immediately if the optional authIdToken parameter was omitted from FirebaseServerApp initialization.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
authIdTokenVerified: () => Promise<void>;
```

## FirebaseServerApp.installationTokenVerified

Checks to see if the verification of the installationToken provided to  has completed.

It is recommend that your application awaits this promise before initializing any Firebase products that use Firebase Installations. The Firebase SDKs will not use Installation Auth tokens that are determined to be invalid or those that have not yet completed validation.

The returned Promise is completed immediately if the optional appCheckToken parameter was omitted from FirebaseServerApp initialization.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
installationTokenVerified: () => Promise<void>;
```

## FirebaseServerApp.name

There is no get for FirebaseServerApp, so the name is not relevant. However, it's declared here so that FirebaseServerApp conforms to the FirebaseApp interface declaration. Internally this string will always be empty for FirebaseServerApp instances.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
name: string;
```

## FirebaseServerApp.settings

The (read-only) configuration settings for this server app. These are the original parameters given in [initializeServerApp()](./app.md#initializeserverapp_30ab697)<!-- -->.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
readonly settings: FirebaseServerAppSettings;
```

### Example


```javascript
const app = initializeServerApp(settings);
console.log(app.settings.authIdToken === options.authIdToken);  // true

```
