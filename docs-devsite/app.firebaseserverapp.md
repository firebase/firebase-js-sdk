# FirebaseServerApp interface
A [FirebaseServerApp](./app.firebaseserverapp.md#firebaseserverapp_interface) holds the initialization information for a collection of services running in server enviornments.

Do not call this constructor directly. Instead, use [initializeServerApp()](./app.md#initializeserverapp_30ab697) to create an app.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export interface FirebaseServerApp extends FirebaseApp 
```
<b>Extends:</b> [FirebaseApp](./app.firebaseapp.md#firebaseapp_interface)

## FirebaseServerApp.authIdTokenVerified

Checks to see if the local verification of the authIdToken provided to [initializeServerApp()](./app.md#initializeserverapp_30ab697) has completed.

It is recommend that your application awaits this promise before invoking getAuth() if an authIdToken was provided in the FirebaseServerAppSettings.

The returned Promise is completed immediately if the optional authIdToken parameter was omitted from FirebaseServerApp initialization.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
authIdTokenVerified: () => Promise<void>;
```

## FirebaseServerApp.name

There is no getApp operation for FirebaseServerApps, so the name is not relevant for applications. However, it may be used internally, and is declared here so that FirebaseServerApp conforms to the FirebaseApp interface declaration.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
name: string;
```

## FirebaseServerApp.settings

The (read-only) configuration settings for this server app. These are the original parameters given in [initializeServerApp()](./app.md#initializeserverapp_30ab697)<!-- -->.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
readonly settings: FirebaseServerAppSettings;
```

### Example


```javascript
const app = initializeServerApp(settings);
console.log(app.settings.authIdToken === options.authIdToken);  // true

```
