# ThinkingConfig interface
Configuration for "thinking" behavior of compatible Gemini models.

Certain models utilize a thinking process before generating a response. This allows them to reason through complex problems and plan a more coherent and accurate answer.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export interface ThinkingConfig 
```

## ThinkingConfig.thinkingBudget

The thinking budget, in tokens.

This parameter sets an upper limit on the number of tokens the model can use for its internal "thinking" process. A higher budget may result in higher quality responses for complex tasks but can also increase latency and cost.

If you don't specify a budget, the model will determine the appropriate amount of thinking based on the complexity of the prompt.

An error will be thrown if you set a thinking budget for a model that does not support this feature or if the specified budget is not within the model's supported range.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
thinkingBudget?: number;
```
