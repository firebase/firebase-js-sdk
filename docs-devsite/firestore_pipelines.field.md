Represents a reference to a field in a Firestore document, or outputs of a  stage.

<p>Field references are used to access document field values in expressions and to specify fields for sorting, filtering, and projecting data in Firestore pipelines.

<p>You can create a `Field` instance using the static  method:

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class Field extends Expression implements Selectable 
```
<b>Extends:</b> [Expression](./firestore_pipelines.expression.md#expression_class)

<b>Implements:</b> [Selectable](./firestore_pipelines.selectable.md#selectable_interface)
