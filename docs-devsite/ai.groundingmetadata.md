# GroundingMetadata interface
Metadata returned when grounding is enabled.

Currently, only Grounding with Google Search is supported (see [GoogleSearchTool](./ai.googlesearchtool.md#googlesearchtool_interface)<!-- -->).

Important: If using Grounding with Google Search, you are required to comply with the "Grounding with Google Search" usage requirements for your chosen API provider: [Gemini Developer API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms#grounding-with-google-search) or Vertex AI Gemini API (see [Service Terms](https://cloud.google.com/terms/service-terms) section within the Service Specific Terms).

```typescript
export interface GroundingMetadata 
```

|  Property | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [groundingAttributions](./ai.groundingmetadata.md#groundingmetadatagroundingattributions) | [GroundingAttribution](./ai.groundingattribution.md#groundingattribution_interface)<!-- -->\[\] |  |
|  [groundingChunks](./ai.groundingmetadata.md#groundingmetadatagroundingchunks) | [GroundingChunk](./ai.groundingchunk.md#groundingchunk_interface)<!-- -->\[\] | A list of [GroundingChunk](./ai.groundingchunk.md#groundingchunk_interface) objects. Each chunk represents a piece of retrieved content (for example, from a web page). that the model used to ground its response. |
|  [groundingSupports](./ai.groundingmetadata.md#groundingmetadatagroundingsupports) | [GroundingSupport](./ai.groundingsupport.md#groundingsupport_interface)<!-- -->\[\] | A list of [GroundingSupport](./ai.groundingsupport.md#groundingsupport_interface) objects. Each object details how specific segments of the model's response are supported by the <code>groundingChunks</code>. |
|  [retrievalQueries](./ai.groundingmetadata.md#groundingmetadataretrievalqueries) | string\[\] |  |
|  [searchEntryPoint](./ai.groundingmetadata.md#groundingmetadatasearchentrypoint) | [SearchEntrypoint](./ai.searchentrypoint.md#searchentrypoint_interface) | Google Search entry point for web searches. This contains an HTML/CSS snippet that must be embedded in an app to display a Google Search entry point for follow-up web searches related to a model's “Grounded Response”. |
|  [webSearchQueries](./ai.groundingmetadata.md#groundingmetadatawebsearchqueries) | string\[\] | A list of web search queries that the model performed to gather the grounding information. These can be used to allow users to explore the search results themselves. |
