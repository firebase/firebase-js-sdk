# ExperimentalOptions interface
Experimental options to configure the Firestore SDK.

Note: This interface is "experimental" and is subject to change.

See `FirestoreSettings.experimental`<!-- -->.

```typescript
export declare interface ExperimentalOptions 
```

## ExperimentalOptions.sendWriteRequestsDelayMs

The maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, to wait before sending a Firestore "write" request to the backend. If `undefined` then do not delay at all.

A delay can be useful because it enables the in-memory "write pipeline" to gather together multiple write requests and send them in a single HTTP request to the backend, rather than one HTTP request per write request, as is done when by default, or when this property is `undefined`<!-- -->. Note that there is a hardcoded limit to the number of write requests that are sent at once, so setting a very large value for this property will not necessarily cause \_all\_ write requests to be sent in a single HTTP request; however, it \_could\_ greatly reduce the number of distinct HTTP requests that are used.

The value must be an integer value strictly greater than zero and less than or equal to 10000 (10 seconds). A value of `200` is a good starting point to minimize write latency yet still enable some amount of batching.

See https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/issues/5971 for rationale and background information that motivated this option.
