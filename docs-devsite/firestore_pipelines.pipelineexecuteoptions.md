An escape hatch to set options not known at SDK build time. These values will be passed directly to the Firestore backend and not used by the SDK.

The option name will be used as provided. And must match the name format used by the backend (hint: use a snake\_case\_name).

Custom option values can be any type supported by Firestore (for example: string, boolean, number, map, …). Value types not known to the SDK will be rejected.

Values specified in rawOptions will take precedence over any options with the same name set by the SDK.

Override the `example_option`<!-- -->:

```
  execute({
    pipeline: myPipeline,
    rawOptions: {
      // Override `example_option`. This will not
      // merge with the existing `example_option` object.
      "example_option": {
        foo: "bar"
      }
    }
  }

```
`rawOptions` supports dot notation, if you want to override a nested option.

```
  execute({
    pipeline: myPipeline,
    rawOptions: {
      // Override `example_option.foo` and do not override
      // any other properties of `example_option`.
      "example_option.foo": "bar"
    }
  }

```

```typescript
rawOptions?: {
        [name: string]: unknown;
    };
```
