# FetchResponse interface

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export interface FetchResponse 
```

## Properties

|  Property | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [config](./remote-config.fetchresponse.md#fetchresponseconfig) | [FirebaseRemoteConfigObject](./remote-config.firebaseremoteconfigobject.md#firebaseremoteconfigobject_interface) | Defines the map of parameters returned as "entries" in the fetch response body.<p>Only defined for 200 responses. |
|  [eTag](./remote-config.fetchresponse.md#fetchresponseetag) | string | Defines the ETag response header value.<p>Only defined for 200 and 304 responses. |
|  [status](./remote-config.fetchresponse.md#fetchresponsestatus) | number | The HTTP status, which is useful for differentiating success responses with data from those without.<p>The Remote Config client is modeled after the native <code>Fetch</code> interface, so HTTP status is first-class.<p>Disambiguation: the fetch response returns a legacy "state" value that is redundant with the HTTP status code. The former is normalized into the latter. |
