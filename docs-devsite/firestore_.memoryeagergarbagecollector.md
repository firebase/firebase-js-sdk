# MemoryEagerGarbageCollector interface
A garbage collector deletes documents whenever they are not part of any active queries, and have no local mutations attached to them.

This collector tries to ensure lowest memory footprints from the SDK, at the risk of querying backend repeated for a document it could have cached locally.

Use factory function  to create a instance of this collector.
