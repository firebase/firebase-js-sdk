# QueryOrderByConstraint class
A `QueryOrderByConstraint` is used to sort the set of documents returned by a Firestore query. `QueryOrderByConstraint`<!-- -->s are created by invoking [orderBy()](./firestore_.md#orderby) and can then be passed to [query()](./firestore_.md#query) to create a new query instance that also contains this `QueryOrderByConstraint`<!-- -->.

Note: Documents that do not contain the orderBy field will not be present in the query result.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class QueryOrderByConstraint extends QueryConstraint 
```
