It is encoded assuming all minutes are 60 seconds long, i.e. leap seconds are "smeared" so that no leap second table is needed for interpretation. Range is from 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z to 9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z.<!-- -->For examples and further specifications, refer to the [Timestamp definition](https://github.com/google/protobuf/blob/master/src/google/protobuf/timestamp.proto)<!-- -->. |
|  [Transaction](./firestore_lite.transaction.md#transaction_class) | A reference to a transaction.<!-- -->The <code>Transaction</code> object passed to a transaction's <code>updateFunction</code> provides the methods to read and write data within the transaction context. See [runTransaction()](./firestore_.md#runtransaction_6f03ec4)<!-- -->. |
|  [VectorValue](./firestore_lite.vectorvalue.md#vectorvalue_class) | Represents a vector type in Firestore documents. Create an instance with . VectorValue |
|  [WriteBatch](./firestore_lite.writebatch.md#writebatch_class) | A write batch, used to perform multiple writes as a single atomic unit.<!-- -->A <code>WriteBatch</code> object can be acquired by calling [writeBatch()](./firestore_.md#writebatch_231a8e0)<!-- -->. It provides methods for adding writes to the write batch. None of the writes will be committed (or visible locally) until [WriteBatch.commit()](./firestore_.writebatch.md#writebatchcommit) is called. |

## Interfaces

|  Interface | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [AggregateSpec](./firestore_lite.aggregatespec.md#aggregatespec_interface) | Specifies a set of aggregations and their aliases. |
|  [DocumentData](./firestore_lite.documentdata.md#documentdata_interface) | Document data (for use with [setDoc()](./firestore_lite.md#setdoc_ee215ad)<!-- -->) consists of fields mapped to values. |
|  [FirestoreDataConverter](./firestore_lite.firestoredataconverter.md#firestoredataconverter_interface) | Converter used by <code>withConverter()</code> to transform user objects of type <code>AppModelType</code> into Firestore data of type <code>DbModelType</code>.<!-- -->Using the converter allows you to specify generic type arguments when storing and retrieving objects from Firestore.<!-- -->In this context, an "AppModel" is a class that is used in an application to package together related information and functionality. Such a class could, for example, have properties with complex, nested data types, properties used for memoization, properties of types not supported by Firestore (such as <code>symbol</code> and <code>bigint</code>), and helper functions that perform compound operations. Such classes are not suitable and/or possible to store into a Firestore database. Instead, instances of such classes need to be converted to "plain old JavaScript objects" (POJOs) with exclusively primitive properties, potentially nested inside other POJOs or arrays of POJOs. In this context, this type is referred to as the "DbModel" and would be an object suitable for persisting into Firestore. For convenience, applications can implement <code>FirestoreDataConverter</code> and register the converter with Firestore objects, such as <code>DocumentReference</code> or <code>Query</code>, to automatically convert <code>AppModel</code> to <code>DbModel</code> when storing into Firestore, and convert <code>DbModel</code> to <code>AppModel</code> when retrieving from Firestore. |
|  [Settings](./firestore_lite.settings.md#settings_interface) | Specifies custom configurations for your Cloud Firestore instance. You must set these before invoking any other methods. |
|  [TransactionOptions](./firestore_lite.transactionoptions.md#transactionoptions_interface) | Options to customize transaction behavior. |

|  [AddPrefixToKeys](./firestore_lite.md#addprefixtokeys) | Returns a new map where every key is prefixed with the outer key appended to a dot. |
|  [AggregateFieldType](./firestore_lite.md#aggregatefieldtype) | The union of all <code>AggregateField</code> types that are supported by Firestore. |
|  [AggregateSpecData](./firestore_lite.md#aggregatespecdata) | A type whose keys are taken from an <code>AggregateSpec</code>, and whose values are the result of the aggregation performed by the corresponding <code>AggregateField</code> from the input <code>AggregateSpec</code>. |
|  [AggregateType](./firestore_lite.md#aggregatetype) | Union type representing the aggregate type to be performed. |
|  [ChildUpdateFields](./firestore_lite.md#childupdatefields) | Helper for calculating the nested fields for a given type T1. This is needed to distribute union types such as <code>undefined &#124; {...}</code> (happens for optional props) or <code>{a: A} &#124; {b: B}</code>.<!-- -->In this use case, <code>V</code> is used to distribute the union types of <code>T[K]</code> on <code>Record</code>, since <code>T[K]</code> is evaluated as an expression and not distributed.<!-- -->See https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html\#distributive-conditional-types |
|  [FirestoreErrorCode](./firestore_lite.md#firestoreerrorcode) | The set of Firestore status codes. The codes are the same at the ones exposed by gRPC here: https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/statuscodes.md<!-- -->Possible values: - 'cancelled': The operation was cancelled (typically by the caller). - 'unknown': Unknown error or an error from a different error domain. - 'invalid-argument': Client specified an invalid argument. Note that this differs from 'failed-precondition'. 'invalid-argument' indicates arguments that are problematic regardless of the state of the system (e.g. an invalid field name). - 'deadline-exceeded': Deadline expired before operation could complete. For operations that change the state of the system, this error may be returned even if the operation has completed successfully. For example, a successful response from a server could have been delayed long enough for the deadline to expire. - 'not-found': Some requested document was not found. - 'already-exists': Some document that we attempted to create already exists. - 'permission-denied': The caller does not have permission to execute the specified operation. - 'resource-exhausted': Some resource has been exhausted, perhaps a per-user quota, or perhaps the entire file system is out of space. - 'failed-precondition': Operation was rejected because the system is not in a state required for the operation's execution. - 'aborted': The operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency issue like transaction aborts, etc. - 'out-of-range': Operation was attempted past the valid range. - 'unimplemented': Operation is not implemented or not supported/enabled. - 'internal': Internal errors. Means some invariants expected by underlying system has been broken. If you see one of these errors, something is very broken. - 'unavailable': The service is currently unavailable. This is most likely a transient condition and may be corrected by retrying with a backoff. - 'data-loss': Unrecoverable data loss or corruption. - 'unauthenticated': The request does not have valid authentication credentials for the operation. |
|  [NestedUpdateFields](./firestore_lite.md#nestedupdatefields) | For each field (e.g. 'bar'), find all nested keys (e.g. {<!-- -->'bar.baz': T1, 'bar.qux': T2<!-- -->}<!-- -->). Intersect them together to make a single map containing all possible keys that are all marked as optional |
|  [OrderByDirection](./firestore_lite.md#orderbydirection) | The direction of a [orderBy()](./firestore_.md#orderby_006d61f) clause is specified as 'desc' or 'asc' (descending or ascending). |

|  [Primitive](./firestore_lite.md#primitive) | Primitive types. |
|  [QueryConstraintType](./firestore_lite.md#queryconstrainttype) | Describes the different query constraints available in this SDK. |
|  [QueryFilterConstraint](./firestore_lite.md#queryfilterconstraint) | <code>QueryFilterConstraint</code> is a helper union type that represents [QueryFieldFilterConstraint](./firestore_.queryfieldfilterconstraint.md#queryfieldfilterconstraint_class) and [QueryCompositeFilterConstraint](./firestore_.querycompositefilterconstraint.md#querycompositefilterconstraint_class)<!-- -->. |
|  [QueryNonFilterConstraint](./firestore_lite.md#querynonfilterconstraint) | <code>QueryNonFilterConstraint</code> is a helper union type that represents QueryConstraints which are used to narrow or order the set of documents, but that do not explicitly filter on a document field. <code>QueryNonFilterConstraint</code>s are created by invoking [orderBy()](./firestore_.md#orderby_006d61f)<!-- -->, [startAt()](./firestore_.md#startat_9a4477f)<!-- -->, [startAfter()](./firestore_.md#startafter_9a4477f)<!-- -->, [endBefore()](./firestore_.md#endbefore_9a4477f)<!-- -->, [endAt()](./firestore_.md#endat_9a4477f)<!-- -->, [limit()](./firestore_.md#limit_ec46c78) or [limitToLast()](./firestore_.md#limittolast_ec46c78) and can then be passed to [query()](./firestore_.md#query_9f7b0f4) to create a new query instance that also contains the <code>QueryConstraint</code>. |
|  [SetOptions](./firestore_lite.md#setoptions) | An options object that configures the behavior of [setDoc()](./firestore_lite.md#setdoc_ee215ad)<!-- -->,  and  calls. These calls can be configured to perform granular merges instead of overwriting the target documents in their entirety by providing a <code>SetOptions</code> with <code>merge: true</code>. |
|  [UnionToIntersection](./firestore_lite.md#uniontointersection) | Given a union type <code>U = T1 &#124; T2 &#124; ...</code>, returns an intersected type <code>(T1 &amp; T2 &amp; ...)</code>.<!-- -->Uses distributive conditional types and inference from conditional types. This works because multiple candidates for the same type variable in contra-variant positions causes an intersection type to be inferred. https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html\#type-inference-in-conditional-types https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50374908/transform-union-type-to-intersection-type |
|  [UpdateData](./firestore_lite.md#updatedata) | Update data (for use with [updateDoc()](./firestore_.md#updatedoc_51a65e3)<!-- -->) that consists of field paths (e.g. 'foo' or 'foo.baz') mapped to values. Fields that contain dots reference nested fields within the document. FieldValues can be passed in as property values. |
|  [WhereFilterOp](./firestore_lite.md#wherefilterop) | Filter conditions in a [where()](./firestore_.md#where_0fae4bf) clause are specified using the strings '&amp;lt;', '&amp;lt;=', '==', '!=', '&amp;gt;=', '&amp;gt;', 'array-contains', 'in', 'array-contains-any', and 'not-in'. |
|  [WithFieldValue](./firestore_lite.md#withfieldvalue) | Allows FieldValues to be passed in as a property value while maintaining type safety. |

## function(n, ...)

### increment(n) {:#increment_5685735}

Returns a special value that can be used with [setDoc()](./firestore_lite.md#setdoc_ee215ad) or [updateDoc()](./firestore_lite.md#updatedoc_51a65e3) that tells the server to increment the field's current value by the given value.

If either the operand or the current field value uses floating point precision, all arithmetic follows IEEE 754 semantics. If both values are integers, values outside of JavaScript's safe number range (`Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER` to `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`<!-- -->) are also subject to precision loss. Furthermore, once processed by the Firestore backend, all integer operations are capped between -2^63 and 2^63-1.

If the current field value is not of type `number`<!-- -->, or if the field does not yet exist, the transformation sets the field to the given value.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function increment(n: number): FieldValue;
```

#### Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  n | number | The value to increment by. |

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function getAggregate<AggregateSpecType extends AggregateSpec, AppModelType, DbModelType extends DocumentData>(query: Query<AppModelType, DbModelType>, aggregateSpec: AggregateSpecType): Promise<AggregateQuerySnapshot<AggregateSpecType, AppModelType, DbModelType>>;

<b>Returns:</b>

Promise&lt;[AggregateQuerySnapshot](./firestore_lite.aggregatequerysnapshot.md#aggregatequerysnapshot_class)<!-- -->&lt;AggregateSpecType, AppModelType, DbModelType&gt;&gt;

### Example


```typescript
const aggregateSnapshot = await getAggregate(query, {
  countOfDocs: count(),
  totalHours: sum('hours'),
  averageScore: average('score')
});

const countOfDocs: number = aggregateSnapshot.data().countOfDocs;
const totalHours: number = aggregateSnapshot.data().totalHours;
const averageScore: number | null = aggregateSnapshot.data().averageScore;

```

### getCount(query) {:#getcount_4e56953}

Calculates the number of documents in the result set of the given query without actually downloading the documents.

Using this function to count the documents is efficient because only the final count, not the documents' data, is downloaded. This function can count the documents in cases where the result set is prohibitively large to download entirely (thousands of documents).

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function getCount<AppModelType, DbModelType extends DocumentData>(query: Query<AppModelType, DbModelType>): Promise<AggregateQuerySnapshot<{
    count: AggregateField<number>;
}, AppModelType, DbModelType>>;
```

Promise&lt;[AggregateQuerySnapshot](./firestore_lite.aggregatequerysnapshot.md#aggregatequerysnapshot_class)<!-- -->&lt;{ count: [AggregateField](./firestore_lite.aggregatefield.md#aggregatefield_class)<!-- -->&lt;number&gt;; }, AppModelType, DbModelType&gt;&gt;

A Promise that will be resolved with the count; the count can be retrieved from `snapshot.data().count`<!-- -->, where `snapshot` is the `AggregateQuerySnapshot` to which the returned Promise resolves.

### getDocs(query) {:#getdocs_4e56953}

Executes the query and returns the results as a [QuerySnapshot](./firestore_.querysnapshot.md#querysnapshot_class)<!-- -->.

All queries are executed directly by the server, even if the query was previously executed. Recent modifications are only reflected in the retrieved results if they have already been applied by the backend. If the client is offline, the operation fails. To see previously cached result and local modifications, use the full Firestore SDK.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function getDocs<AppModelType, DbModelType extends DocumentData>(query: Query<AppModelType, DbModelType>): Promise<QuerySnapshot<AppModelType, DbModelType>>;
```

Helper for calculating the nested fields for a given type T1. This is needed to distribute union types such as `undefined | {...}` (happens for optional props) or `{a: A} | {b: B}`<!-- -->.

In this use case, `V` is used to distribute the union types of `T[K]` on `Record`<!-- -->, since `T[K]` is evaluated as an expression and not distributed.

See https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html\#distributive-conditional-types

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type ChildUpdateFields<K extends string, V> = V extends Record<string, unknown> ? AddPrefixToKeys<K, UpdateData<V>> : never;
```

## FirestoreErrorCode

The set of Firestore status codes. The codes are the same at the ones exposed by gRPC here: https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/statuscodes.md

Possible values: - 'cancelled': The operation was cancelled (typically by the caller). - 'unknown': Unknown error or an error from a different error domain. - 'invalid-argument': Client specified an invalid argument. Note that this differs from 'failed-precondition'. 'invalid-argument' indicates arguments that are problematic regardless of the state of the system (e.g. an invalid field name). - 'deadline-exceeded': Deadline expired before operation could complete. For operations that change the state of the system, this error may be returned even if the operation has completed successfully. For example, a successful response from a server could have been delayed long enough for the deadline to expire. - 'not-found': Some requested document was not found. - 'already-exists': Some document that we attempted to create already exists. - 'permission-denied': The caller does not have permission to execute the specified operation. - 'resource-exhausted': Some resource has been exhausted, perhaps a per-user quota, or perhaps the entire file system is out of space. - 'failed-precondition': Operation was rejected because the system is not in a state required for the operation's execution. - 'aborted': The operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency issue like transaction aborts, etc. - 'out-of-range': Operation was attempted past the valid range. - 'unimplemented': Operation is not implemented or not supported/enabled. - 'internal': Internal errors. Means some invariants expected by underlying system has been broken. If you see one of these errors, something is very broken. - 'unavailable': The service is currently unavailable. This is most likely a transient condition and may be corrected by retrying with a backoff. - 'data-loss': Unrecoverable data loss or corruption. - 'unauthenticated': The request does not have valid authentication credentials for the operation.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type FirestoreErrorCode = 'cancelled' | 'unknown' | 'invalid-argument' | 'deadline-exceeded' | 'not-found' | 'already-exists' | 'permission-denied' | 'resource-exhausted' | 'failed-precondition' | 'aborted' | 'out-of-range' | 'unimplemented' | 'internal' | 'unavailable' | 'data-loss' | 'unauthenticated';
```

## NestedUpdateFields

For each field (e.g. 'bar'), find all nested keys (e.g. {<!-- -->'bar.baz': T1, 'bar.qux': T2<!-- -->}<!-- -->). Intersect them together to make a single map containing all possible keys that are all marked as optional

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type NestedUpdateFields<T extends Record<string, unknown>> = UnionToIntersection<{
    [K in keyof T & string]: ChildUpdateFields<K, T[K]>;
}[keyof T & string]>;
```

## OrderByDirection

The direction of a [orderBy()](./firestore_.md#orderby_006d61f) clause is specified as 'desc' or 'asc' (descending or ascending).

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type OrderByDirection = 'desc' | 'asc';
```

## PartialWithFieldValue

Similar to TypeScript's `Partial<T>`<!-- -->, but allows nested fields to be omitted and FieldValues to be passed in as property values.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type PartialWithFieldValue<T> = Partial<T> | (T extends Primitive ? T : T extends {} ? {
    [K in keyof T]?: PartialWithFieldValue<T[K]> | FieldValue;
} : never);
```

## Primitive

Primitive types.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type Primitive = string | number | boolean | undefined | null;
```

## QueryConstraintType

Describes the different query constraints available in this SDK.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type QueryConstraintType = 'where' | 'orderBy' | 'limit' | 'limitToLast' | 'startAt' | 'startAfter' | 'endAt' | 'endBefore';
```

## QueryFilterConstraint

`QueryFilterConstraint` is a helper union type that represents [QueryFieldFilterConstraint](./firestore_.queryfieldfilterconstraint.md#queryfieldfilterconstraint_class) and [QueryCompositeFilterConstraint](./firestore_.querycompositefilterconstraint.md#querycompositefilterconstraint_class)<!-- -->.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type QueryFilterConstraint = QueryFieldFilterConstraint | QueryCompositeFilterConstraint;
```

## QueryNonFilterConstraint

`QueryNonFilterConstraint` is a helper union type that represents QueryConstraints which are used to narrow or order the set of documents, but that do not explicitly filter on a document field. `QueryNonFilterConstraint`<!-- -->s are created by invoking [orderBy()](./firestore_.md#orderby_006d61f)<!-- -->, [startAt()](./firestore_.md#startat_9a4477f)<!-- -->, [startAfter()](./firestore_.md#startafter_9a4477f)<!-- -->, [endBefore()](./firestore_.md#endbefore_9a4477f)<!-- -->, [endAt()](./firestore_.md#endat_9a4477f)<!-- -->, [limit()](./firestore_.md#limit_ec46c78) or [limitToLast()](./firestore_.md#limittolast_ec46c78) and can then be passed to [query()](./firestore_.md#query_9f7b0f4) to create a new query instance that also contains the `QueryConstraint`<!-- -->.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type QueryNonFilterConstraint = QueryOrderByConstraint | QueryLimitConstraint | QueryStartAtConstraint | QueryEndAtConstraint;
```

## SetOptions

An options object that configures the behavior of [setDoc()](./firestore_lite.md#setdoc_ee215ad)<!-- -->,  and  calls. These calls can be configured to perform granular merges instead of overwriting the target documents in their entirety by providing a `SetOptions` with `merge: true`<!-- -->.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type SetOptions = {
    readonly merge?: boolean;
} | {
    readonly mergeFields?: Array<string | FieldPath>;
};
```

## UnionToIntersection

Given a union type `U = T1 | T2 | ...`<!-- -->, returns an intersected type `(T1 & T2 & ...)`<!-- -->.

Uses distributive conditional types and inference from conditional types. This works because multiple candidates for the same type variable in contra-variant positions causes an intersection type to be inferred. https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html\#type-inference-in-conditional-types https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50374908/transform-union-type-to-intersection-type

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type UnionToIntersection<U> = (U extends unknown ? (k: U) => void : never) extends (k: infer I) => void ? I : never;
```

## UpdateData

Update data (for use with [updateDoc()](./firestore_.md#updatedoc_51a65e3)<!-- -->) that consists of field paths (e.g. 'foo' or 'foo.baz') mapped to values. Fields that contain dots reference nested fields within the document. FieldValues can be passed in as property values.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type UpdateData<T> = T extends Primitive ? T : T extends {} ? {
    [K in keyof T]?: UpdateData<T[K]> | FieldValue;
} & NestedUpdateFields<T> : Partial<T>;
```

## WhereFilterOp

Filter conditions in a [where()](./firestore_.md#where_0fae4bf) clause are specified using the strings '&amp;lt;', '&amp;lt;=', '==', '!=', '&amp;gt;=', '&amp;gt;', 'array-contains', 'in', 'array-contains-any', and 'not-in'.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type WhereFilterOp = '<' | '<=' | '==' | '!=' | '>=' | '>' | 'array-contains' | 'in' | 'array-contains-any' | 'not-in';
```

## WithFieldValue

Allows FieldValues to be passed in as a property value while maintaining type safety.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type WithFieldValue<T> = T | (T extends Primitive ? T : T extends {} ? {
    [K in keyof T]: WithFieldValue<T[K]> | FieldValue;
} : never);
```
