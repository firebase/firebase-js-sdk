# Detects if any project config files (rules or functions) have changed,
# and deploys them to the test project used for CI if so.
# Run this in its own workflow instead of as a step before each test
# workflow to avoid too many deploys, possibly causing race conditions.
# Since the build step of each test workflow takes a long time, this
# this should finish before the tests begin running.
