  <p>
   XmlHttpRequests that initiate from code executed in an iframe, that is then
    destroyed, result in an error in FireFox.  This test case is used to verify
    that Closure's IframeIo and XhrLite do not suffer from this problem.  See
   <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=369939">

   </a>
   .

  <p>
   NOTE(pupius): 14/11/2011 The XhrMonitor code has been removed since the
    above bug doesn't manifest in any currently supported versions.  This test
    is left in place as a way of verifying the problem doesn't resurface.
