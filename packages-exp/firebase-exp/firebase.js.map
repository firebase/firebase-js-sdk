Whereas goog.Uri adds several kilobytes to the binary regardless\n * of how much of its functionality you use, this is designed to be a set of\n * mostly-independent utilities so that the compiler includes only what is\n * necessary for the task.  Estimated savings of porting is 5k pre-gzip and\n * 1.5k post-gzip.  To ensure the savings remain, future developers should\n * avoid adding new functionality to existing functions, but instead create\n * new ones and factor out shared code.\n *\n * Many of these utilities have limited functionality, tailored to common\n * cases.  The query parameter utilities assume that the parameter keys are\n * already encoded, since most keys are compile-time alphanumeric strings.  The\n * query parameter mutation utilities also do not tolerate fragment identifiers.\n *\n * By design, these functions can be slower than goog.Uri equivalents.\n * Repeated calls to some of functions may be quadratic in behavior for IE,\n * although the effect is somewhat limited given the 2kb limit.\n *\n * One advantage of the limited functionality here is that this approach is\n * less sensitive to differences in URI encodings than goog.Uri, since these\n * functions operate on strings directly, rather than decoding them and\n * then re-encoding.\n *\n * Uses features of RFC 3986 for parsing/formatting URIs:\n *   http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt\n */\n\ngoog.provide('goog.uri.utils');\ngoog.provide('goog.uri.utils.ComponentIndex');\ngoog.provide('goog.uri.utils.QueryArray');\ngoog.provide('goog.uri.utils.QueryValue');\ngoog.provide('goog.uri.utils.StandardQueryParam');\n\ngoog.require('goog.asserts');\ngoog.require('goog.string');\n\n\n/**\n * Character codes inlined to avoid object allocations due to charCode.\n * @enum {number}\n * @private\n */\ngoog.uri.utils.CharCode_ = {\n  AMPERSAND: 38,\n  EQUAL: 61,\n  HASH: 35,\n  QUESTION: 63\n};\n\n\n/**\n * Builds a URI string from already-encoded parts.\n *\n * No encoding is performed.

Data is stored persistently\n * across sessions.\n *\n * On Web only, the Firestore SDKs support shared access to its persistence\n * layer. This allows multiple browser tabs to read and write to IndexedDb and\n * to synchronize state even without network connectivity. Shared access is\n * currently optional and not enabled unless all clients invoke\n * `enablePersistence()` with `{synchronizeTabs:true}`.\n *\n * In multi-tab mode, if multiple clients are active at the same time, the SDK\n * will designate one client as the “primary client”. An effort is made to pick\n * a visible, network-connected and active client, and this client is\n * responsible for letting other clients know about its presence. The primary\n * client writes a unique client-generated identifier (the client ID) to\n * IndexedDb’s “owner” store every 4 seconds. If the primary client fails to\n * update this entry, another client can acquire the lease and take over as\n * primary.\n *\n * Some persistence operations in the SDK are designated as primary-client only\n * operations. This includes the acknowledgment of mutations and all updates of\n * remote documents. The effects of these operations are written to persistence\n * and then broadcast to other tabs via LocalStorage (see\n * `WebStorageSharedClientState`), which then refresh their state from\n * persistence.\n *\n * Similarly, the primary client listens to notifications sent by secondary\n * clients to discover persistence changes written by secondary clients, such as\n * the addition of new mutations and query targets.\n *\n * If multi-tab is not enabled and another tab already obtained the primary\n * lease, IndexedDbPersistence enters a failed state and all subsequent\n * operations will automatically fail.\n *\n * Additionally, there is an optimization so that when a tab is closed, the\n * primary lease is released immediately (this is especially important to make\n * sure that a refreshed tab is able to immediately re-acquire the primary\n * lease). Unfortunately, IndexedDB cannot be reliably used in window.unload\n * since it is an asynchronous API. So in addition to attempting to give up the\n * lease, the leaseholder writes its client ID to a \"zombiedClient\" entry in\n * LocalStorage which acts as an indicator that another tab should go ahead and\n * take the primary lease immediately regardless of the current lease timestamp.\n *\n * TODO(b/114226234): Remove `synchronizeTabs` section when multi-tab is no\n * longer optional.\n */\nclass tr {\n    constructor(\n    /**\n     * Whether to synchronize the in-memory state of multiple tabs and share\n     * access to local persistence.\n     */\n    t, e, n, s, i, r, o, c, a, \n    /**\n     * If set to true, forcefully obtains database access.
